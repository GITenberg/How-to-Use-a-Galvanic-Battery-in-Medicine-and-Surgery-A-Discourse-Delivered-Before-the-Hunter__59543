<h2><a id="NOTE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION"></a>NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>


<p>This Discourse was first published in compliance
with the request of several of those who heard it
delivered, and who expressed to me an opinion
that busy practitioners might perhaps be glad to
have at hand, and in small compass, such information
as it contained. It was obviously impossible
to do more in so limited a time than to make a
general reference to the therapeutic uses of electricity;
and the most that I attempted in this direction
was to recall to the recollection of my
audience those conditions of disease in which the
application of electricity would seem&mdash;without
doubt&mdash;to be required; and to indicate the
methods of application most generally useful.
The construction of apparatus can not be understood
from verbal or written description alone;
and I appended to the text certain notes, and
illustrations of the instruments which I submitted
to the Society.</p>

<p>With the Second Edition I incorporated three
Lectures which I delivered at the National
Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic; and to
this Edition I have appended such additional
matter as I believe will prove useful to the
student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I may add that I have endeavoured, as was said
by a deceased physician, “to paint electro-therapeutics
not imperfectly, but, as it were, in miniature:”
and that while I have carefully revised
every page, and have noticed all real improvements
introduced to the profession since the First Edition,
I have kept the book a small book: and I venture
to hope a book easily to be understanded by the
multitude of practitioners who ask daily what
instruments to use, and when, and especially how,
to use them.</p>

<p>These questions I have endeavoured to answer
in the following pages, which contain such details,
and such details only, as I believe it essential for
the practitioner to master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminary Remarks.</div>

<p>When your Council did me the honour
to ask me to bring before you the subject of
Electro-therapeutics, I felt that the invitation was
addressed rather to the Hospital to which I am
attached than to myself, seeing that to it belongs
the merit of having been for some years the pioneer
and outpost, so to say, in this metropolis of the
scientific and methodical application of electricity
to the alleviation and removal of disease; and that
we are indebted to one of its distinguished physicians
for a remarkable investigation into animal
electricity, and the demonstration that much of
what we have been accustomed to attribute to a
“vital principle” may, in reality, be the effect only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of electrical charge and discharge<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (a valuable contribution
to the correlation of the Physical Forces);
and to my predecessor for the discovery of the
special influence of voltaic currents in certain
forms of paralysis.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>As it is one of our objects in our practice here
to study the scope and the limits of electricity as
a remedy in disease, it seemed to me not inappropriate
to devote my first Lectures to electro-therapeutics;
and the more so, as few medical men
have a practical knowledge of the subject; and I
fear that the profession generally, through lacking
this practical knowledge, are to some extent
responsible for the utter and astounding recklessness
with which the laity&mdash;ever ready to rush in
where physicians fear to tread&mdash;are prone to apply
painful and dangerous electrization, not to themselves,
but to their suffering friends; while it is
still too common for the medical practitioner (as
quoted by Golding Bird upwards of forty years
ago) to consider that when his fiat has gone forth
“let the patient be electrified,” he has done all
that is necessary, while the patient usually carries
out this mandate by the purchase of a rotary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
magneto-electric machine, and by using it according
to the directions of its maker, who is generally
about as well fitted to teach its application in
disease as is the maker of an amputating knife to
operate with it!</p>

<p>The almost complete absence in the medical
schools of the great hospitals of opportunities for
an adequate study of electro-therapeutics, the importance
of the subject, and the widespread attention
that it is awakening throughout the profession,
have also determined me to sketch as briefly as is
consistent with clearness the present position of
the science and practice of medical electricity, and
especially of its practice.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Electricity, Gentlemen, is by no means one of
those remedies that, failing to do good, is little
likely to do harm. On the contrary, in injudicious
hands, it is potent for evil, while the benefit to be
derived from it is in exact proportion to the
judgment and care with which it is administered.
Moreover, the results of its employment are dependent,
more than with any other therapeutic agency,
upon the methods by which it is applied&mdash;methods
that should be familiar, not alone to a few specialists,
but to every practitioner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Addressing you who are engaged in active
practice, with little time to devote to medical
electricity, it will, I think, be more acceptable for
me not to weary you with a tedious discourse
upon the elementary principles of electricity, for
the practical application of these matters concerns
rather the instrument-maker than the medical
practitioner, and I shall discuss none of them,
except incidentally, and <em>with precise reference to
their application to medicine</em>. Besides, we know
little of them, and I cannot forget that Faraday
said that “he once thought he knew something
about electricity, but the more he investigated it
the less he found he understood it.” Let us
then be content with its definition as a “<span class="smcap">Force</span>,”
“pervading all nature, latent in every substance,
and liable at any moment to be excited by
mechanical or chemical means.”</p>

<p>Nor do I propose to make these Lectures in any
sense exhaustive, but, on the contrary, to include
in them only such information as is essential, and
such as you may readily, and without effort, retain
in your memory. I shall direct especial
attention to practical points which are of importance
to the successful use of electricity; for from
non-observance of small details of application
many failures have resulted, the treatment getting
a measure of discredit, which in <em>strict justice</em> should
have attached only to the operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>In the present Lecture I shall consider instruments,
their construction and management, a dry
subject, but an essential one, the first requisite of
a good workman being complete familiarity with
his tools, lacking which he will be the victim of
constantly recurring annoyances and difficulties;
for although the present position of electro-therapeutics
is largely due to improved methods of
administration, these methods would be impossible
with faulty instruments, while, on the other hand,
the most perfect instruments require a certain
amount of skill and care in their management,
and some acquaintance with at least the mechanical
details of their construction; and without this
rudimentary knowledge it is also impossible to
usefully compare one instrument with another.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>My second Lecture will be devoted to the different
methods of applying electricity, and my third
and last to its uses in the diagnosis and treatment
of disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varieties of Electricity.</div>

<p>We make use of three varieties of electricity in
medicine.</p>

<p>Firstly, of static or friction electricity, the electricity
of glass and amber, appropriately called
from its early investigator, <em>Franklinism</em>.</p>

<p>Secondly, of the electricity of chemical action,

<h3>FRANKLINISM.</h3>

<p>Franklinism, sometimes of the utmost value,
and far surpassing, in certain cases, any other form
of electricity, has some inconveniences in its
application, and has hitherto been little used but
by specialists. Recent improvements in Franklinic
instruments have, however, largely removed
these inconveniences, and have placed at the
general service of the profession a remedy of much
good and still greater promise. The fundamental
requisite in all Franklinic machines, consists in
the rotation of a glass plate against a leathern or
other rubber, and the accumulation of the resulting
electricity upon a metallic receiver, insulated
by a non-conducting support, usually of glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Franklinism</div>

<p>Discarding the primitive cylinder machine, now
long since disused, we will firstly consider the
plate machine in which the electricity arising
from the friction of the rotating glass plate against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the upper and lower cushions, is collected by two
brass arms and distributed to the brass conductor,
from which they branch out, and which is insulated
by a glass support.</p>

</div>

<p>The machine should be fixed upon a firm stand
that it may be quite steady during rotation, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be screwed to a heavy painted deal table, as is
shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

Winter’s Machine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When very seldom used, <em>and where expense is a
consideration</em>, very <em>fair</em> results may be obtained
from a Winter’s machine with a plate of only
15 inches in diameter, and which is easily carried.
In this instrument, <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, the fact that the quantity
of electricity which may be accumulated upon
a conductor is dependent upon its size has been
most ingeniously applied, the surface of the conductor
being enormously increased by the insertion
into a large wooden ring of a core of thick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
iron wire. Electricity accumulates upon the wire,
and is prevented from escaping by the insulating
wooden covering.</p>

<p>But in the daily or frequent use of Franklinism
it is essential, equally for the comfort of the
operator, as for the benefit of the patient, that the
most efficient apparatus should be provided. The
one delineated in <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, and which I habitually
use, is that known as Carrè’s, but I have modified
it by having attached to it a second accumulator,
or conductor (the first time, I am led to understand,
that such an improvement has been added
to any such machine). This arrangement admits
of the patient receiving the charge of either
positive or negative electricity&mdash;a condition said
by some physicians to be of primary importance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>
Static Machine with Gas Engine and Insulating Stool.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are other machines, but I do not propose
to weary you with their descriptions.</p>

<p>When <em>any</em> Franklinic apparatus is in use its
plate or plates should be evenly and uniformly
rotated, and it is much better to have this done
mechanically rather than by a man or maid-servant.</p>

<p>I use a “Bischoff’s” gas engine, shown to the
right hand in <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>. It consists of a cylinder,
surmounted by a hollow column serving as a guide
to the piston. From the extremity of this column
there is a very long connecting rod which acts
upon the crank of the shaft of the fly-wheel and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
driving-pulley. When the piston ascends it
draws in during four-tenths of its course a mixture
of air and gas from the pipes. A little before the
piston has ascended half-way a gas jet ignites the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mixture. There is a slight explosion without the
least effect on the sides of the cylinder, but sufficiently
strong to push the piston and cause it to
complete its course. In consequence of this movement
the piston is raised and acts on the connecting
rod, forcing it upwards and half turning the
fly-wheel. On account of the speed acquired, and
of the impulse given, the fly-wheel continues its
course by means of the crank and connecting rod,
and sends the piston to the starting-point again.
Then it ascends again, taking in a fresh charge of
air and gas, motion being imparted anew to the
driving shaft by every revolution of the engine.</p>

<p>An engine of 2-man power, with an altitude
from the ground to the top of the column of 4 feet,
and with a fly-wheel measuring 2 feet 6 inches in
diameter, is amply sufficient for every purpose. It
works evenly and without noise; it is absolutely
free from danger, and it is placed instantly in or
out of action by merely igniting or extinguishing a
single gas jet. But it is remarkable that no one seems
to have suggested&mdash;even before the gas-engine era&mdash;that
a “fly-wheel” with a pulley would obviate
the old difficulty of the unsatisfactory rotation of
the Plate machine. Going into a hair-cutter’s
shop I found the apparatus, figured to the left of
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, standing in the shop to work the customary
“hair brushing machinery” instead of its
being, as is usual, fixed upon an upper floor. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
obtained one, and fitted it in the manner shown, to
a Carrè’s machine. The fly-wheel is so heavy that
it can be rotated by the operator without the aid
of an assistant, by his giving the handle an occasional
“swing round.” Its momentum then keeps
it revolving a sufficient number of times before the
next “swing” is required, to enable him to leave it
and attend to his patient. The manner in which
the band from it is attached to a small wheel in
rear of the Static machine is also shown in the
Figure.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> the patient is being “charged” with
<em>positive</em> electricity, or, as the electro-therapeutists
of fifty years ago would have said, “he is taking
an electro-positive bath,” by being insulated and
connected through the metallic rod held in his
hand with the accumulator upon which the
positive electricity is stored, while the negative
electricity is “run off” by a brass chain leading
from the negative accumulator to the ground.
If the process were reversed, the positive accumulator,
being connected with the ground, and the
patient with the negative one seen at the top of
the machine, he would be taking “an electro-negative
bath;” for we make him, as it were, a
part of each accumulator as the case may be; its
accumulated electricity passes to him and he becomes
<em>charged</em>. If the air were perfectly dry he
would continue (as he is insulated) in this charged
condition, but owing to its contained moisture the
electricity rapidly leaves him, and to maintain the
charge it is necessary that the plate of the machine
should be kept in constant rotation. Indeed, the
escape of electricity is so rapid that to get the best
action we must have a fire in the room, and before
use well rub the plate, the insulating supports, the
legs of the stool, and all the glass parts of the
apparatus with a warm and dry piece of flannel.
This is of importance, and however dry the day,
should as a rule never be neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>By smearing the inside of the cushions of the
machine with a little paste, composed of an alloy
of mercury and tin (technically known as
“amalgam”), mixed with a little tallow, the
amount of electricity is much increased, but care
should be taken not to smear the cushions with too
much, which had better be bought ready prepared.
A piece about the size of a small grape for
each of the cushions will be enough, and no more
need be added for two or three weeks. Always
scrape off old amalgam before adding new. The
cushions should be screwed sufficiently tight to
slightly “grip” the plate, and if it is found that
notwithstanding having rubbed the glass of the
apparatus as above directed, the instrument is not
supplying a sufficient quantity of electricity, remove
the cushions and warm them thoroughly.
<em>It is impossible to be too careful that everything is
warm, clean, and dry</em>, for the great obstacle that
exists against the extended use of Franklinism is
found in this difficulty sometimes present, from
neglect of the above precautions, in getting
efficient action. But even on a foggy day the
instrument, <em>with proper care</em>, may be made to act
well. The operator should also remember that
dust must be sedulously guarded against. A
few drops of petroleum may be sprinkled upon
the table, and their vapour condensing upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the machine will aid in protecting it against
moisture.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>There will also be needed two or three lengths
of brass chain, or of copper wire, and a stool about
4 feet by 2 feet, with four glass balls or legs. A
stool of this size admits of a chair being placed
upon it, as in <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, and it will be also useful for
certain applications of voltaism, which will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mentioned later on. Four glass jars are also needed
with which to insulate an ordinary couch.</p>

</div>

<p>A chair, insulated by being screwed to
a glass platform, as in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a><em>a</em>, <em>running on
castors</em>, is an improvement upon the old-fashioned
glass-legged stool.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Franklinization by Sparks.</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, the electricity is escaping from
all points of the skin, but if it is desired to localize
somewhat this escape along the course of certain
nerve branches, or otherwise, but to avoid shock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a brush may be slowly passed by the operator
almost, but not quite, in contact with the skin.
A series of rapid and successive reunions of the
electricity with each bristle of the brush takes
place, generating a current of cold air perceptible
to the patient. I habitually use for this application
an ordinary clothes-brush. If while in connection
with the conductor any object (the knuckles
will do) is brought sufficiently near to the patient
for his contained electricity to overcome the resistance
of the intervening stratum of air, he is
“<em>discharged</em>” with a spark. This is <em>Franklinization
by sparks</em>, and is accompanied by a certain
slight amount of “shock.”</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>, improved “dischargers,” and a convenient
metallic connecting rod are shown.</p>

<p>The ball terminations of the dischargers should
vary in size, for within certain limits, the larger
the ball the more intense the spark; with the
pointed end the spark is very small; with the
discharger terminating in many small metallic
points still smaller, and with a similar discharger
made of wood, a luminous glow alone results, and
no spark.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I shall discuss, in my third Lecture, the therapeutic
values of Franklinism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3>VOLTAISM OR GALVANISM.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Voltaism.</div>

<p>The Voltaic current is a <em>continuous</em> current.
Unless artificially interrupted, the electricity flows
in an unbroken stream until the battery is exhausted.
The current will gradually lessen in
power until it ceases, but there will be no break
in it, and no change in its direction, which is
uniformly from the positive to the negative pole.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Points of distinction between the Voltaic and Faradaic Currents.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It is important to recollect these points, for they
constitute the chief physical distinction between
the Voltaic and the Faradaic&mdash;or, as it is sometimes
called, the Induced current. This latter is
not, strictly speaking, a “<em>current</em>,” but a rapid
discharge or succession of momentary shocks, each
perfectly distinct in itself, and separated by an
appreciable interval of time from its fellows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voltaic Cells.</div>

<p>In electrization, a source of electricity is of
course necessary, and this is furnished by a cell
or cells, with contained elements and chemicals;
and, until a few years ago, it was impossible to
get a <em>portable</em> cell that remained always in order
and ready for use.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Requisites of a Portable Battery.</div>

<p>The requisites of a portable battery are that it
should be really portable, always ready for use,
and little liable to get out of order. Such batteries
may be divided into two classes: firstly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
those in which the elements are either lowered
into the exciting fluid or the fluid is lifted to
them, as in the instruments of Stöhrer, Weiss,
and almost all other makers; and, secondly, those
in which the elements remain immovable in their
cells, and of these the Leclanché, the Gaiffe-Clamond,
and the chloride of silver, are to be generally
preferred to any of the first-named construction,
for they admit of the cells being so nearly sealed
up that no fluid can be spilt by any movement
except turning the battery quite upside down;
while the somewhat common accident with batteries
of the first-named construction&mdash;viz., destruction
of the plates by leaving them in the acid,
with its anything but agreeable result of a considerable
expense to replace them, is obviously
impossible. The only disadvantage they possess is
that when exhausted it is necessary to send them
to the maker to be recharged, <em>while the owner can
keep the first-named variety in order himself</em>.</p>

<p>Efficient cells are, however, but a first step to
the perfection of electrical apparatus, and the mechanism
by which the current is brought into use
and graduated, and the general accessories of the
instrument, are of at least equal importance. The
instruments which I am about to describe, have
been designed by myself, and may be obtained
from Mr. Hawksley, Surgical Instrument Maker,
Oxford Street. It is claimed for them that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
place at the service of the busy practitioner a
battery that with ordinary care (and no instrument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
will remain in order without this) may
be kept upon his consulting-room table, always
as available to his service as his stethoscope or
ophthalmoscope.</p>

<p>Three kinds of batteries are constructed:&mdash;A
Voltaic battery, with any required number of
cells, from 15 to 100; a Faradaic battery; and a
Combined battery, uniting both Voltaic and
Faradaic currents.</p>

and sponge-holders, &amp;c.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Voltaic Battery.</div>

<p><em>The Voltaic Battery</em> (see <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>, p. 20) has
its cells arranged in the interior of a mahogany
case, and in use they are hidden from view
and from danger, but I now partially expose
them by removal of the tray for holding the
sponges and accessories. Their connecting wires
are brought across the under surface of the
element board, which is made to move upon
hinges that, when necessary, the cells may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
examined, but at other times this element board
is held in position by a bolt, and it should never
be needlessly disturbed. These wires conduct the
current through the graduating dial, and the position
of the needle of this dial determines from
how many of the cells the electricity shall be
allowed to reach the binding screws, and from
them, by way of the conductors, sponge-holders,
or electrodes, the body of the patient,<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it shall be entirely shut off, as is the case when
the battery is not in use, and when the needle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>stands at “0” (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>). When the needle points to any
stud numbered on the dial, the number of cells
marked on that stud are brought into action, and
the needle is made just wide enough to touch one
of the studs before it breaks contact with the
preceding one, and thus the current may be
increased or decreased in power without shock, and
while the electrodes are held applied to the
patient; but if it were not so made a series of
painful shocks would be communicated whenever
the current was increased or decreased. Should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the needle, from forgetfulness, be left when out of
use in any other position than at “0,” a guard
upon the lid of the instrument prevents its
being shut, and the operator has his attention
called to his inadvertence. A Voltaic alternative,
or change of direction of the current, is sometimes
required in treatment, and the commutator of the
poles enables this to be accomplished without
alteration in the position of the conductors. By
pushing forwards or backwards the handle which
moves a lever working below the element board
the current is instantly reversed, and the alternation
of the letters “P” and “N” seen through
holes cut in the element board indicates at once
not only that there has been a change of poles,
but which pole is at the moment negative or positive;
whereas in all previous instruments, when
the poles have been changed, there has either
been no letter marking them, or this letter has
really been wrong, and one has had to remember
this; and under such circumstances, and examining
patients in rapid succession, momentary confusion
of the poles was very liable to occur, even
to a practised operator. A key enables the
current to be shut off or on without removal of
the conductors. Dirt is a non-conductor of
electricity, and the studs of the dial must be kept
clean with emery paper or plate-powder, as also
the under surface of the needle, key, and binding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
screws, which unscrew to admit of removal. In
the daily use of a battery the chief work is usually
thrown upon the first half (say in a battery of
forty cells, upon the first twenty-five), and various
arrangements have been added to batteries by
ingenious instrument-makers to enable the operator
to vary his selection of the cells to be brought
into use, and thus to relieve the first half of his
battery, or, in other words, to equalize its work.
But this unequal work question is more a theoretical
than a practical evil; for if the initial cells
grow weaker a greater number can be placed in
use. I have carefully studied all the proposed
modifications, and have found in all of them
the remedy worse than the disease, unless the
graduating dial be doubled (an original suggestion
of my own), so that the initial cells of
one week may be made the terminal cells of the
next.</p>

<h3>FARADISM.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Faradaic Current.</div>

<p>The Faradaic, induced, interrupted, or electro-magnetic
current, is the third form of electricity
employed in medicine. Faraday, as you will recollect,
discovered, that if two metallic wires were so
fixed as to be parallel and close to each other, but
not to touch; and that if then a current of Voltaic
electricity were sent along the first wire, another
current appeared in the second. This <em>secondary</em>
or <em>induced</em> current, as it is called in contradistinction
to the current, the <em>primary</em> or <em>inducing</em> current
sent along the first wire is only momentary,
but it appears again for a moment when the first
current ceases, but in a reverse direction. It is
most convenient to wind these two wires round
two reels, so as to form separate coils, and to place
the primary within the secondary coil. Each
single turn of the primary then acts not only on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the parallel turn of the secondary wire, but on all
the turns near it, and the power of such an apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is much greater than that which would be
obtained by the same lengths of wire running side
by side in a straight line. Our two coils being
thus arranged, we pass through our primary wire
a succession of electrical currents, and in practice
this is accomplished by connecting its extremities
with a battery supplying a continuous current,
which by an ingenious mechanism we frequently
break or interrupt.</p>

<p><em>The Faradaic Battery.</em>&mdash;In <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a> (see p. 29),
a Faradaic battery, worked by two Leclanché cells,
is shown; but I find it better to employ either
one or two ordinary bichromate cells instead of
the Leclanché, as the former can be kept in order by
the operator himself without much trouble. The
primary coil is fixed upon a pedestal, the secondary
is movable, and can be lifted over or thrust away
from the primary. The degree of action in the
secondary coil being proportionate to the extent
to which it is brought under the influence of
the primary, this arrangement admits of the
most perfect graduation of the current; and it has
been for some time in use in all well-constructed
instruments. The innovation I have made consists
in limiting the primary coil to its legitimate
purpose of induction, and rendering the secondary
alone available for application to a patient. I
have been long satisfied that therapeutically the
distinction between the primary and secondary
coil entirely consists in the greater tension of the
current of the secondary coil enabling it to penetrate
easily several thicknesses of muscle, but there
is no therapeutic indication that cannot be fulfilled
by this secondary coil; and at its lowest
power I have frequently applied it to the conjunctiva.
The rapidity of vibration of the interrupting
hammer is varied by increasing or decreasing the
distance between the point of the needle and the
electro-magnet by the protrusion or retraction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the screw, of which the needle forms the end&mdash;that
is, by increasing or decreasing the space
through which the hammer passes in its vibration,
and also by altering the pressure of its spring, but
there is seldom therapeutic need for change of vibration;
and unless this exists it is better <em>not to alter
the adjustment so long as the instrument acts well</em>.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
After considerable use the point of the needle, and
the exact spot of the platinum disk of the hammer
against which this needle impinges, become oxidized,
causing weakening or stoppage of the current.
This platinum disk has been constructed to rotate,
and a hole has been drilled in its circumference (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).
By inserting a little lever furnished with the instrument
into this hole, the slightest twist given
to the disk is sufficient to bring a new surface of
platinum into contact with the needle point. This
will usually be all that is required, but, if not, the
needle can be unscrewed, and its point cleaned with
emery paper. When in course of time the disk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
becomes dotted over with spots of oxidation, the
screw fixing the hammer in position must be unscrewed,
the hammer lifted out, and its surface
similarly cleaned.</p>

</div>

<p>Induction currents are also produced in coils
of wire by the action upon them under certain
conditions of a permanent magnet&mdash;as in the
ordinary rotary magneto-electric machine&mdash;but
these machines may be discarded from our consideration,
for they are uncertain in action,
painful in application, and do not admit of exact
graduation.</p>

<p>An apparatus in which both currents are combined
is extremely convenient if it is so constructed
that either the Voltaic or Faradaic current can be
brought to the same terminals, thus avoiding the
trouble of changing the conductors&mdash;a point of the
greatest possible convenience when examining
patients for diagnostic purposes by both forms of
electricity, either in succession or alternately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hospital Combined Battery.</div>

<p>In the <em>Hospital Combined Battery</em> (see <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>),
constructed from my designs, the two currents are
thus united, and its details are precisely similar to
those of the separate batteries, with the exception
of the Dial being furnished with an additional stud
lettered <em>Coil</em>. When the needle points to this stud
the current from the Faradaic coil is brought into
action; when it points to the numbered studs,
the cells numbered thereon as in my Voltaic instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and when it points to “0,” both currents
are shut off.</p>

<p>Other instruments, such as those of Stöhrer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Weiss, are excellent, and were unsurpassed until
the invention and improvement of the Leclanché
and other cells. But I might talk upon instruments
for hours without exhausting the list; and
I have felt obliged to limit myself to a description
of those I believe best fitted to our requirements;
but it, of course, must be understood that my
further <em>observations will apply equally to currents of
electricity furnished by any properly constructed and
reliable apparatus</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accessories of the Battery.</div>

<p>We have now brought the electricity to the
terminals of our battery, and we must next consider
the best means of conveying it to the sponges,
conductors, or, as they are generally termed, rheophores
or current carriers, by which it is finally
applied to our patient.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Conducting Cords.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Our first necessary accessory
is a conducting cord or wire, and it is of
the first importance that this should really be
what it is called&mdash;“<em>a conductor</em>”&mdash;for any fault or
break of connection in it will, of course, nullify the
best and most perfect battery. It must also be
sufficiently pliable, and be insulated by being coated
with some non-conducting material that the
electricity may not escape from it to any conducting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
substance with which it may accidentally
come into contact. The conducting cords sold by
instrument-makers are sometimes not insulated at
all, and then they are quite useless, but they are
more commonly composed of several strands of
metallic wire of about the diameter of sewing
thread, the whole enclosed in some silken or woollen
material, and nothing can be better than these
latter when quite new. Their disadvantages are
that they become frayed after a little use, and are
liable to be constantly out of order, causing interruptions
in the current, while they will only fit
one kind of machine. I have had endless trouble
with them; and for some years I have used
nothing but thin copper wire, coated with gutta
percha in the same way as that known as “telegraph
wire.” This is perfectly insulated, sufficiently
pliable for all practical purposes; it is
cheap, and can be made to fit any sort of connection.
Its one disadvantage is, that it is liable
to break at the point where it is received into the
terminals of the battery, or the screw socket of
the rheophore. Should this happen, all that is
necessary is to scrape off the gutta percha coating
with a pocket knife for an inch from the broken
end, by which we get practically a new conducting
cord.</p>

<p>We have now considered fully the birth and
parentage of medical electricity, and we have conducted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
it to within almost a hair’s breadth of our
patient. The various methods of applying it will
be considered in our next Lecture, which I trust,
Gentlemen, to render more interesting; but the
dry details we have been discussing are, I assure
you, essential as a secure foundation for a practically
useful survey of electro-therapeutics.</p>

<h2>LECTURE II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">METHODS OF APPLYING ELECTRICITY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">Résumé of First Lecture.</div>

<p>In our first Lecture we studied the different
kinds of electricity employed in medicine,
and the construction and management of batteries.
I reminded you that we made use of three kinds of
electricity; firstly, of friction or static electricity,
<em>Franklinism</em>; secondly, of the electricity of chemical
action, <em>Voltaism</em>, or <em>Galvanism</em>; and, thirdly, of
induced electricity, <em>Faradism</em>:&mdash;that there had been
certain difficulties in the employment of Franklinism,
but that these difficulties no longer existed;
that Voltaic electricity was electricity in motion, or
current electricity, but that while its current (unless
artificially interrupted) was always <em>continuous</em>&mdash;flowing,
that is, in an unbroken stream&mdash;and from
the positive to the negative pole, until the battery
was exhausted&mdash;it by no means followed that it was
<em>constant</em>, that is, that it did not vary appreciably
in power during application; that only batteries
supplying a fairly constant current were fitted for
medical use, and that all others should be rejected.
We then considered different batteries, both fixed
and portable; that while large fixed low tension<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
batteries were unquestionably superior in their
therapeutic effects, patients unfortunately were
not always movable, and that a portable battery
became, therefore, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i>; that portable
batteries might be conveniently divided into two
classes, one in which electricity was generated by
the elements being immersed in an exciting fluid
only during actual use, and being taken out of the
fluid immediately after use; and the second that
in which no removal of the elements was necessary;
that the Voltaic current was graduated into doses
by some arrangement determining the number of
cells to be employed in each case, but that this
method, while practically useful and sufficient,
failed to convey an exact idea of a measured and
unvarying quantity of electricity; and that it
had been contended that by the use of a galvanometer,
doses of electricity might be as accurately
administered as so many grains or minims of
ordinary medicines, but that, perfect as the theory
might be, I had personally failed to obtain help
in practice from a galvanometer; that next in
importance to a method of dosage, was it to be
able to instantly change the direction of the
current, or to at once turn it “off” or “on,” in
addition, of course, to the fundamental requisite
of a continuous supply of electricity of sufficient
quality and quantity.</p>

<p>We next considered the induced or <em>Faradaic</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
current, so-called, which I reminded you is not a
current at all, but a rapid discharge or succession
of those momentary shocks, each perfectly distinct
in itself, and separated by an appreciable interval
of time from its fellows, which Faraday discovered
to be generated or induced by a Voltaic current
flowing along a wire in other wires parallel to,
but separated from, the first wire; that by winding
the two wires upon two movable reels and introducing
one within the other, not only might
these <em>secondary</em> currents be multiplied indefinitely
in proportion to the number of spirals of wire, but
by introducing or withdrawing the one from within
the other an exact method of graduation was
afforded us. I pointed out to you that there was
no therapeutic distinction between the so-called
primary and secondary currents, and I recommended
you therefore to use only the currents of
the secondary coil. I then showed you the
construction of Faradaic instruments, and of
instruments combining both Voltaic and Faradaic
currents, and our survey was completed by a consideration
of the different varieties of conducting
wires or cords, and my recommendation of thin
gutta-percha covered copper wire as generally
superior to any other form. We have to-day to
study methods of applying electricity, and to learn
how to use the instruments, with the construction
and properties, of which I trust you are now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
familiar; and, Gentlemen, it is well worth your
while to have obtained this knowledge, for its
possession will not only enable you to readily
rectify any faults in the working of your batteries,
but the necessity of sending them to the instrument-maker
may be often avoided.</p>

<p>We have already studied methods of applying
Franklinism.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Voltaization and Faradization may both be
applied either generally&mdash;as in the different forms
of electrical baths&mdash;or locally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Application of Electricity.</div>

<p>A convenient method of applying electricity,
when very strict localization is not required, is to
insert the feet and hands of the patient, or one
foot and one hand, as the case may be, in separate
vessels containing tepid salt and water with which
the conducting wires of the battery are in contact,
the current being allowed to circulate during the
time required. Ordinary foot-pails, basins, or
jugs, will fulfil every requirement; while thick
telegraph wire answers well to connect the battery
with the vessels of water, as it is little liable to
break and wears well. A variety of the constant
current (originated by Dr. Radcliffe) is very
readily applied in the way just described, with
the addition only of some means of insulating the
patient and the accessories, and of a length of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ordinary uninsulated copper wire.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Radcliffe’s Positive Charge.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Dr. Radcliffe
believes that an administration of <em>positive</em> Voltaic
electricity, somewhat analogous to the charge of
Franklinic electricity, is frequently beneficial. He
insulates the patient and the accessories, and
having connected the negative pole with the earth
by a wire which he calls a “ground-wire,” he
allows the current to pass. With careful insulation
the negative electricity passes away by the
wire, and while the current circulates the patient
continues “charged” with positive electricity.
There must be two wires from the negative pole,
one to be applied, as well as the positive, to
the patient, and the other taken “to earth.”
This latter may be conveniently attached to a
chandelier or gas-pipe, which always gives a
direct metallic conduction to the ground. A perforated
vulcanized indiarubber mat, or a sheet
of gutta percha, or a glass-legged stool can
be employed to insulate the patient and the
accessories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Electric Bath.</div>

<p>There is another generalized application which
has been much advocated, and remarkable statements
have been put forth, not only of its curative
power in almost every disease, but also of its
purely physical and chemical effects&mdash;I refer to
that by “Electric Baths,” several establishments
of which exist in London, but you need not send
your patients to them. You can teach them how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to take an electric bath in their own bed or bath-room.
A bath sufficiently large for the patient to
recline in it should be insulated by glass supports
(four stout tumblers will do very well), and filled
with water at a temperature of 95 to 100 degrees.
A metallic plate in connection with one pole may
be inserted at the head, and a second plate in
connection with the other pole at the foot of the
bath. The patient should be protected from direct
contact with either plate by sitting upon a wooden
framework. With a sufficiently powerful current,
a portion of the electricity will pass through the
body of the patient reclining thus between the
poles. Another method is to connect the water
with one pole, and for the patient to grasp in his
unimmersed hands a copper bar covered with wet
flannel, and in connection with the second pole of
the battery; or a conductor from this second pole
may be held almost, but not quite, in contact with
any part of the body immersed in the water.
Either the Voltaic or Faradaic current may be
used. Ordinary water with the Faradaic current,
but salt and water, or acidulated water, with the
Voltaic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Faradization.</div>

<p>Another more generalized application is that
introduced by Beard and Rockwell, under the name
of “General Faradization.” The patient sits with
his naked feet upon a sheet of copper connected
with one pole, while the other pole is connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by a moistened sponge with the left hand of the
operator, who passes his disengaged hand, slightly
moistened, over the muscles of the patient, and
sometimes over his whole body. The current, I
need hardly say, passes through the body of the
operator before it reaches the patient, and the
sensation he feels is his chief guide to its graduation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Centralized Galvanization.</div>

<p>Another general application is the “Centralized
Galvanization” of the same authors, in which
their object is to bring the whole central nervous
system under the influence of the Voltaic current.</p>

<p>They place one pole&mdash;usually the negative&mdash;at
the epigastrium and pass a large moistened sponge
from the positive pole over the forehead and top
of the head, along the inner border of the sterno-mastoid,
from the stylo-mastoid fossa to the
sternum, and down the entire length of the spine,
from the nape of the neck to the sacrum. The
brain, sympathetic and spinal cord, and the pneumogastric
nerves are thus submitted to the
influence of the current.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Localized Electrization.</div>

<p>But the great majority of cases require&mdash;not a
generalized, but a strictly localized application,
and for the fundamental principles of all methods
of localized electrization we are indebted to the
late Dr. Duchenne (the “father of electro-therapeutics”),
for before him no one had attempted
any local application of electricity that could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
properly be so called. Indeed, to Duchenne may
be fairly ascribed the very birth of medical electricity
as a branch of therapeutics, and in the true
and kindly words of the <cite>Lancet</cite>, when announcing
his death:&mdash;“No field of work was ever seized
upon with more eagerness; ever cultivated with
more earnestness; or perhaps ever made to yield
a better harvest than that which the discovery of
induced electricity placed at the disposal of the
man whose genius was the first to recognize, and
his talents to secure, the opportunity it afforded.
Taking his work at its lowest estimate, he was a
man to whom medical science owes a large debt of
gratitude, and whose memory deserves a warm
tribute of regard.” Duchenne’s two test experiments,
demonstrating the fundamental principles
of his method, I will now repeat upon the posterior
surface of my left forearm. I propose to arrest
Faradism in the skin, without allowing it to
stimulate the subjacent muscles. To do this it is
necessary for the skin to be quite dry&mdash;moisture,
as you know, being a conductor of electricity&mdash;and
to make sure of sufficient dryness, I sprinkle
the skin with a little starch powder. I now apply
to the dry skin the dry metallic conductors of an
induction instrument in action. I am afraid you
cannot see, Gentlemen, the small sparks produced
as the two electricities combine upon the cutaneous
surface, or hear the slight crackling sound produced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but you observe no muscular contraction,
and what I feel is a superficial and evidently
cutaneous sensation. I now replace the dry conductors
by well-moistened sponges. You observe
that I have not altered the power of the current,
but that there is energetic contraction of the
extensor muscles. This is quite involuntary, and
is due to the electric irritation of the branches of
the motor nerves.</p>

<p>It follows from these experiments that we may,
at pleasure, arrest electricity in the skin, and that
without puncture or incision we may make the current
traverse the skin, and concentrate its action
upon subcutaneous organs. It was at one time
objected that the muscular contraction was the
result&mdash;not of irritation limited to the muscle or its
motor nerves&mdash;but of reflex action; but Duchenne
demolished this objection by a vivisection. Having
removed the skin from the face of a living rabbit&mdash;to
whom chloroform had been administered&mdash;he
divided the facial nerve of one side only, in order
that the muscles supplied by it might be cut off
from all connection with the cord. He then
applied electric excitation to each muscle of the
face, alternately, on the two sides. The muscles
contracted separately and equally on both sides.
He then destroyed the brain of the same animal,
in order to place the cord in a condition favourable
to the production of reflex action, and again excited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the muscles as before. The results were absolutely
the same.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Muscular electrization may be produced either&mdash;as
I have just shown you&mdash;by placing the conductors
upon the muscle itself, a procedure termed
<em>direct</em> or <em>intra-muscular</em> electrization, or by exciting
only the motor nerve trunk, which is termed <em>indirect</em>,
or <em>extra-muscular</em> electrization, and which we
shall consider presently.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>
Cylindrical Sponge-holder.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Different kinds of Rheophores.</div>

<p>For direct excitation of the larger muscles it is
convenient to use well-moistened sponges, contained
in cylinders of different sizes, or metallic
disks, covered with wet leather and having conveniently
shaped handles. A useful size of cylinder
is one such as this (see <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>), having a depth of
about <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> by <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">8</span></span> inches, which allows the sponge to
fairly fill it, while in such forms as this&mdash;6 inches
by 1&mdash;when the sponge is inserted the lower three-fourths
of the cylinder is empty, and the conduction
of the current liable to become imperfect.
Such a cylinder as this, without any insulating
handle at all, is worse than useless, and is a still
persisting relic of the barbarous time when the
patient was invariably electrized by causing him
to hold the conductors one in each hand, a proceeding
extremely dangerous in certain pathological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
conditions, and in other cases not likely to be
of benefit to him. The insulating handles should
be well hollowed out, that they may be used, lying
comfortably between the fingers, when holding two
in the same hand. The disk rheophore (see <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>),
a metallic button covered with wash-leather, is
extremely useful; it has the advantage over the
sponge of allowing firm pressure to be made without
the inconvenience of water being squeezed out, while
by using its edge it may be made to answer in the
majority of cases for a pointed conductor, which is
fitted chiefly for application to very small muscles,
such as the interossei and some of those of the
face. The wire is attached to the conductor by being
screwed into the socket (see a′, <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>). A conducting
cord is very apt to get frayed at the point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
juncture, and that the wire which I recommend is
not open to this objection is not the least of its
advantages.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Direct Electrization.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In direct electrization the rheophores
should be firmly pressed down upon all points of
the surface of the muscle, that all of its fasciculi may
be equally electrized. With the Faradaic current it
is convenient to apply the rheophores, held in the
same hand (see <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>), for from twenty to thirty
seconds, to every part of the surface of the muscle,
or group of muscles, promenading them as nearly
as may be in lines from the origin to the insertion
of the muscles. If the rheophores are not held in
the same hand care should be taken to keep them
near to one another, for the tension or penetrating
power of Faradism is so great, that without this
precaution there will be liability to excite reflex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
action. With the interrupted Voltaic current this
liability does not exist, and a better plan when
using it is to hold the sponge from the positive
pole stationary, near to the origin of the muscles,
and to stroke or paint as it were the entire
muscular surface with the sponge from the negative
pole, gliding it in lines from the position of
the positive. In using the constant Voltaic current
both sponges must be held quite immovable,
and so applied it differs altogether in its effects
from the very same strength of current interrupted
by moving the conductors. I will demonstrate
these different applications upon the extensors of
my left wrist and fingers&mdash;Faradism&mdash;Voltaism&mdash;Constant
Current.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Indirect Electrization.</div>

<p>Indirect, or extra-muscular electrization, next
claims our attention. You will recollect that it is
produced by acting upon the special nerve trunk
and its branches, instead of by placing the rheophores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
upon the muscle itself. We may thus call
a motor nerve into action without affecting the
cutaneous nerves, and with a minimum of power
of current, and necessarily a minimum of sensation
which hardly ever need amount to actual pain.
This method is preferable, therefore, in cases
where we desire to produce muscular contraction
and as little sensation as may be, and again when
the sedative influence of the constant Voltaic
current is required to be localized in any special
nerve. In its application it is convenient to place
a good-sized sponge connected with one pole upon
an indifferent part of the body, such as the sternum,
and to apply a pointed conductor from the
second pole directly over the course of the nerve
it is desired to act upon. Speaking generally,
these motor points as they are called may be
selected by reference to a good anatomical plate,
but only approximately, for we know that it is
common to find variations in the course of the
nerves and in the mode of their distribution among
the muscles, and this being so, it is well when we
propose to act upon a motor or mixed nerve
(which is not paralyzed), to make sure that we
are localizing the current in it by producing for a
moment the contraction of its muscles and then
marking the spot by touching it with a pencil of
nitrate of silver. This, of course, is only necessary
where in our subsequent electrization we do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
wish muscular contraction, as in the treatment of
neuralgia.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I will demonstrate indirect electrization
by Faradizing the median nerve in my left
forearm above the wrist, and before it passes
beneath the annular ligament of the carpus. It
lies a little below the surface, between the tendons
of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus.
You observe that its muscles powerfully contract
and oppose the thumb to the other fingers, at the
same time abducting it. There occurs also a
slight flexure of the first phalanges of the
index and middle fingers. Professor Ziemssen in
his work on Medical Electricity has published
some extremely accurate plates of the motor points
of the body, and I have grouped together the
more important of them in a chart or map for
convenient reference.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Ziemssen’s method of procedure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was to find out experimentally the points
where the application of electricity most readily
produced muscular contraction. He then marked
these points with coloured chalk, and after a sufficient
number of trials with nitrate of silver.
Photographs of the parts thus marked were taken
and afterwards transferred to the wood blocks.
These figures may therefore claim to be true to
Nature, although they may not be absolutely
correct for every individual. Ziemssen verified
their approximate exactitude by following the
course of the nerves very accurately in the dissecting-room
and observing their points of entrance
into, and their course within, their muscles, with
constant reference to the surface of the body; but
he was not completely satisfied until he had determined
the motor points upon the skin immediately
after death, and before the reaction to electricity
had disappeared, and submitted these points to
the scalpel. The results of the three methods
coincided perfectly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cutaneous Electrization.</div>

<p>We will next consider cutaneous electrization.
I have already shown you that when the skin and
the conductors are both quite dry, a Faradaic
current of moderate power (and practically this
form of electricity is always employed in cutaneous
electrization) does not penetrate the skin, but is
localized upon its surface. There are three
methods of applying cutaneous Faradization&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
method that we employed&mdash;that of “<em>Metallic Conductors</em>;”
the “<em>Electric Hand</em>,” as it is called, in
which the operator having applied one conductor
to some little sensitive part of the patient’s body,
holds the second in his left, and passes the back
of his right hand over the points he wishes to
excite, these points of the patient’s skin and the
back of his hand being dry, and sprinkled with
absorbent powder; and the “<em>Wire Brush</em>,” a
brush of metallic wire, which replaces one of the
conductors, and which is moved over the skin.
With a strong Faradaic current this wire brush
becomes the most powerful of all the excitants of
the skin which do not disorganize its structure;
in fact it was proposed by some scientific parliamentary
philanthropist as a substitute for
flogging in the navy, and I have no doubt
that more intense pain may be produced by it
than by any application of the cat, however well
laid on!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Electrization of Internal Organs.</div>

<p>The methods of electrizing internal organs need
not detain us long. The rectum and muscles of
the anus may be electrized by introducing into
the rectum the rectal rheophore, a metallic stem
insulated by gum elastic, and moving it over the
internal surface, bringing it also into contact with
the levator and sphincter ani. A well-moistened
sponge connected with the other pole may be
applied to the abdominal muscles or to the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the anus. The rectum must be first
freed from fæcal matter.</p>

<p>The bladder is most readily electrized by the introduction
into the rectum of the rectal rheophore,
and into the bladder&mdash;previously emptied&mdash;of a
curved metallic sound insulated by an elastic
catheter to within an inch of its vesical extremity.
This sound must be brought into contact successively
with all points of the neck of the bladder.
The uterus by the introduction of the rectal rheophore,
connected with one pole, to the os uteri, and
by the application of two sponges from the other
pole, one to the abdominal parietes, the other to
the lumbar region. The larynx, externally by one
sponge to the nape of the neck, and the second to
the exterior of the larynx; or, internally, a sponge
to the neck as before, and the introduction by the
aid of the laryngoscope of a small bit of sponge at
the end of a curved metallic stem, insulated by a
gum-elastic catheter, the current not being allowed
to pass until it is seen by the laryngeal mirror
that the sponge is in the desired position. The
male genital organs by moist rheophores to the
scrotum over the testicle; but if it be desired to
excite the vesiculæ seminales, the bowel is first
emptied, the rectal rheophore is then introduced
and so directed that its olive-shaped termination
may be brought into relation with the vesiculæ.
For this purpose it is sufficient to move the rheophore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from right to left and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versá</i>. A powerful
current will penetrate the intestine and reach the
vesiculæ, exciting them energetically. The circuit
is completed by a second rheophore placed on an
unsensitive part of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Electrization of the Central Organs.</div>

<p>In electrization of the central organs of the
nervous system, the Voltaic current is alone used,
and in its application to the brain, the sympathetic
nerves, or the organs of the senses, especial
circumspection must be employed. As a general
rule it should not be had recourse to when central
excitement is contra-indicated, and in <em>all cases</em> the
minimum dose should be commenced with, and the
application discontinued upon the occurrence of
giddiness, nausea, or cerebral symptoms. With
these precautions the brain may be electrized by
well-moistened sponges applied to each mastoid
process, to each temple, or to the frontal and
occipital protuberances. The sponges must be
held immovable. To galvanize the superior
cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, one electrode
of small size must be deeply pressed into the
auriculo-maxillary fossa, and the other with a
good-sized sponge applied over the sixth or seventh
cervical vertebra, or to the manubrium sterni,
close to the border of the sterno-mastoid. The
spinal cord may be electrized by keeping one
sponge, usually the positive, stationary, and moving
the other up and down by the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
vertebræ, or one pole may be applied to the spine,
and the other held to a nerve or muscle. The
retina by a moistened conductor to the closed
eye, and the second to the temple or to the mastoid
process of the same side. The auditory nerve
by one conductor tipped with sponge and inserted
to the bottom of the meatus, the second being
held in the hand of the opposite side; or the
meatus may be filled with tepid water, and a
metallic wire traversing the axis of a vulcanite
tube may be immersed in the water, the second
conductor being a well-moistened sponge to the
nape of the neck. Direct application to the ocular
muscles or to the conjunctiva is usually inadmissible,
but one pole may be placed over the facial
nerve below the ear, and the other applied to the
closed eyelid, or the operator may use the forefinger
of his right hand, covered by a finger-stall
of wet linen as an electrode, passing the current
through his own body by holding a moistened
sponge from one pole in his left hand, the conductor
from the second pole being similarly held in
one of the hands of the patient. This application
is not only convenient, but it is calculated
to allay the fears of a sensitive patient: or a
pointed conductor, covered with wet leather, may
be connected with one pole, and its point held
immovable and firmly pressed down upon the
orbital margin, as near as possible to the position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the muscle it is desired to excite, while the
patient touches at intervals the sponge from the
second pole held by its insulating handle in the
operator’s disengaged hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Electrolysis Needles.</div>

<p>The chemical action of a continuous Voltaic
current is sometimes useful in the removal or dispersal
of tumours, and in the consolidation of
aneurisms, one or more needles being introduced
into the tumour, and connected with a Voltaic
battery. I shall discuss this subject in our next
Lecture, but I have here some of the most generally
useful needles (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>), and I have had made for them
holders with eyelet-holes for the attachment of
conducting wires which render the operator independent
of special conducting cords, for with a
coil of insulated wire and a pocket knife he can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
fit up his needles in a few minutes in any way
best adapted to his proposed operation.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Precautions in mode of Application.</div>

<p>Having now considered the more generally useful
methods of application, it may perhaps not be
out of place to remind you in concluding this part
of our subject that certain precautions are necessary
to be observed. We must keep constantly
before our attention that we are prescribing or administering
an exceedingly powerful remedy, and
with all new patients we should commence with a
minimum dose, watch its effect, and if we need to
increase it, do so gradually&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i>, muscular contraction
being sought we must use the power just
sufficient to produce it and <em>no more</em>&mdash;and so on
with other applications; and it is especially necessary
to use care in applying the Voltaic current to
the face, neck, or any part of the head. Duchenne
blinded a patient by suddenly applying a current
from 40 cells to the facial muscles, and he had the
candour to publish his misfortune. Sudden applications
and sudden cessations should especially
be guarded against. The cessation shock can, of
course, only occur in cases where the conductors
having been held immovable, and the current
gradually increased, one or both of them has been
abruptly, and it may be inadvertently, removed;
and I have known a patient so frightened by such
a cessation shock as to decline further treatment.
The negative pole of a Voltaic battery will, if frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
applied to the same spot, soon cause a
sore, and to avoid this the point of application
should be slightly varied occasionally; and let me
impress upon you, Gentlemen, the importance of
always testing electricity upon yourselves before
applying it to a patient. Use as many galvanometers,
or so-called “instruments of precision,”
as you like, but use in addition the back of your
left hand as a convenient approximate test for the
Voltaic, and your thumb muscles for the Faradaic
current, except when about to apply electricity to
your patient’s head or face, and make it then an
invariable rule to first apply to your own face the
same strength of current you are about to administer
to your patient’s. If you authorize your
patient to have treatment carried out at home impress
this rule upon whosoever electrizes him.
Under such circumstances it is especially imperative,
for there is great belief, even with educated
persons who ought to know better, that the benefit
derived from electrization is in exact proportion to
the pain given by it, and a little personal experience
is a very wholesome corrective to such a notion.
Graduate your dose, then, by the number of cells
employed checked by testing its effect, and do this
upon each application, for there is no certain means
of securing that the strength of either a Voltaic or
a Faradaic current shall not have varied from day
to day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now studied, Gentlemen, medical
electricity, electrical instruments, and methods of
application. In our next and concluding Lecture
I propose to discuss the assistance that electricity
affords us in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ELECTRICITY IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT.</span></h2>


<h3>A.&mdash;<em>Electricity in Diagnosis.</em></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">Electro-Diagnosis.</div>

<p>Our first two Lectures were devoted to a
consideration of electrical instruments; the different
varieties of electricity; and the most approved
methods of applying them in therapeutics.
To-day we have to study their uses in diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Test of Electro-Irritability.</div>

<p>The chief use of electricity in diagnosis is dependent
upon its power of evolving muscular contraction.
We have seen&mdash;as I demonstrated to
you upon my left forearm&mdash;that both muscles and
nerves, when in a normal condition, respond to
the stimulus of electricity. In disease this response,
or irritability, may remain unaltered, or it
may be increased, decreased, or abolished; and
our first step in electro-diagnosis should therefore
be to ascertain the exact condition of electro-contractility.
As in practically almost all our
cases we have to do with altered reaction existing
only in one nerve or muscle, or in one of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
symmetrical groups of nerves or muscles, we
possess a ready means of testing irritability by
ascertaining its relative condition upon opposite
sides of the body, as, for example, in an ordinary
case of hemiplegia.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Test of Farado-Irritability.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In examining such a case
electrically&mdash;and the principles of procedure are
the same in all cases&mdash;it is convenient to commence
our investigation with the Faradaic current, and
to ascertain the <em>lowest</em> power which will call into
action any one of the muscles of the healthy side,
and then to apply this same strength of current
<em>to identical points of the corresponding muscle on the
diseased side</em>, noting whether it causes contraction.
If so, we decrease the power of the current, when
if contraction still occurs there is increased irritability,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versá</i>, as the case may be. Having
ascertained the condition of the muscle we proceed
similarly to test its motor nerve, for we shall see
hereafter that in certain diseased conditions
muscle and nerve irritability are affected unequally.
One conductor being held to an indifferent
part of the body we apply a fine-pointed
conductor to the most superficial point in the
course of the nerve, in the way that, as you will
recollect, I electrized my left median nerve.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Test of Voltao-Irritability.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> We
next submit the muscle and nerve to similar
examination with the Voltaic current. Holding
both conductors immovable, we interrupt the
current for a moment by moving the “key” of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
our battery, or if it is not provided with a key,
while one conductor is stationary, we break the
current by lifting and reapplying the other. It is
essential that on both sides there should be exact
similarity in the application, and that the electrodes
should be placed on identical points of the
muscle, and this is especially important with the
Voltaic current, for healthy muscle responds to it
more readily when it flows down the limb, that is,
with the positive pole nearest to the spine, and
the negative farther from it than when it flows up,
and consequently a reversal of the poles will influence
the result.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rule for strength of Current.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In testing a case in which there
is equal disease upon both sides&mdash;as in some cases
of paraplegia&mdash;we must be guided by a knowledge
of the strength of current usually required to
induce contraction. As a general rule, unless a
current that causes energetic and painful action
in the muscles of the ball of the thumb produces
some contraction, irritability is impaired. If, in
our examination of the muscle, we find irritability
normal to both currents, we have proof of the
integrity of the muscular tissue. If the muscle
also responds by contraction to electrization of its
nerve, we have further proof that the nerve is
healthy, and also the spinal cord at the point of
origin of the nerve.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electro-Irritability diminished.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
If we find the irritability
lessened, there is disease of either muscular tissue,
nerve or cord; and, as a rule, this will be in direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
proportion to the amount of diminished irritability.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electro-Irritability increased.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Increased irritability points to increased vascularity
or irritative lesion; but in such cases we very
seldom require the aid of electricity to complete
our diagnosis.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Voltao-Irritability increased.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The reactions of Faradism and
Voltaism are usually equal, but in some cases in
which muscular response to Faradism is diminished
or abolished the muscular reaction to an interrupted
Voltaic current is not only preserved but
increased. The diseased muscle will respond
much more readily to the Voltaic current than the
corresponding muscle of the healthy side; while
at the same time it will be found on examining
the nerve that there is equal diminution to both
currents.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Diagnosis of Peripheral from Central Disease.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This increased muscle reaction is due
to the special irritability of muscular tissue, and is
quite independent of any nerve influence. It
exists only in peripheral and never in central
lesion, and by it we obtain an absolute diagnosis
of such cases as local paralysis of the facial nerve
from facial hemiplegia, paralysis of the extensors of
the wrist and fingers, due to lead poisoning, from
commencing muscular atrophy, or progressive
muscular atrophy from paralysis from section of a
nerve&mdash;all important questions as affecting treatment.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>“The Degenerative Nerve Reaction.”<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It is known as the “degenerative nerve
reaction,” as it always follows when a nerve trunk
is involved in the lesion. There is then diminution
of Faradaic irritability through both nerve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and muscle, diminution of reaction to the Voltaic
current when the rheophores are applied over the
nerve, and increase of reaction when they are
applied over the muscle; but there is no relation
between these interesting variations in the electrical
condition of nerve and muscle, and the
degree of paralysis to the will, for there may be
perfect muscular paralysis, as in hemiplegia, when
the electrical condition of both nerve and muscle
is unchanged; but, on the other hand, in muscles
equally paralyzed we may find absolute electrical
changes in some, and none in others. We may
often positively predict that these latter will
rapidly recover&mdash;one instance of the use of electricity
in prognosis.</p>

<p>After long disuse of healthy muscles a slight
degree of diminution of electric irritability may
sometimes be present, but this is always restored
by two or three Faradizations, and its existence
is hardly likely to present any difficulty in diagnosis.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Central Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
With this qualification we find that in
paralysis from brain disease electric irritability is
normal, except when irritative lesion is present,
and then it is increased.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Spinal Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In paralysis from disease
of the substance of the cord irritability is diminished,
and this will sometimes aid us in the
diagnosis&mdash;not always easy&mdash;between commencing
paraplegia and locomotor ataxy. In ataxy&mdash;at
least in its early stages&mdash;irritability is normal. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
progressive muscular atrophy it is normal as long
as any muscular tissue remains.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Hysterical Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In hysterical or
emotional paralysis irritability is normal, but
electro-sensibility is often much impaired.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Diagnosis between Real and Feigned Disease.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electricity as Proof Positive of Death.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> These
variations will sometimes enable us to distinguish
between real and pretended disease; and, finally,
absolute abolition of electric irritability in all the
muscles of the body is proof positive of death, so
that those extraordinary people who are haunted
by a fear of being buried alive may rest contented
if they provide that after apparent death, and
before burial, their bodies shall be submitted to
thorough electrical examination.</p>

<p>Considered solely as an aid to diagnosis, we can
get little more assistance from electricity than I
have pointed out to you.</p>

<p>And now, Gentlemen, we come to the consideration
of the last and most important branch of our
subject&mdash;electricity as a therapeutic agent&mdash;its
scope and its limitations as a remedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limitation of Electricity as a remedy.</div>

<p>Is it needful for me to say that there is too
much belief and too much unbelief in its therapeutic
power?</p>

<p>The men who estimate it fairly are quite the
minority. It is generally either much undervalued,
or else believed to be a sort of modern “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elixir
Vitæ</i>,” capable of curing a hopeless hemiplegia from
destruction of brain tissue, or a paralysis agitans
from senile degeneration. Although electricity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
will do neither of these impossibilities, yet,
considered as a remedy, it is of great value in a
wide margin of diseases. It will either stimulate
or soothe both nerve and muscle, according to its
variety and mode of application; it will frequently
restore voluntary movement, it will relieve pain,
heighten temperature, recall sensation, coagulate
the blood, and dissolve or slowly cause the absorption
of tumours.</p>


<h3>B.&mdash;<em>Electricity in Treatment.</em></h3>


<h4>FRANKLINIZATION.</h4>

<p>Franklinization as the oldest form of electricity
and as partaking more of a general application
than a local, may be conveniently considered first.</p>

<p>Administered by the various methods described
at pages <a href="#Page_6">6 to 17</a>, it has been found in the practice of
the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic,
and in private cases coming under my own
observation, of considerable value.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Facial Neuralgia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
<em>Facial neuralgia</em>,
for example, which has resisted other modes of
treatment, may occasionally be relieved with
rapidity and permanently by drawing sparks along
the track of the affected branch or branches of the
trifacial nerve.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Sciatica.<span class="hidev">|</span></span><span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Facial Spasms.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Sometimes also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obstinate sciatica</i>
has been partially or altogether removed; so also
<em>facial spasm</em>, (tic convulsif), as in the following
instance, for permission to quote which I am indebted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to Dr. Radcliffe. A female, forty-eight
years of age, had suffered for thirteen years
from spasm of the muscles of the left side of
the face. The distortion produced by the spasm
was very great, and was apt to be so much
exaggerated by slight emotion, even such as
would be caused by having to address a stranger,
as to make speaking difficult, and to prevent
proper attention to her occupation as a small
shopkeeper. An experimental trial was made
of electrization by sparks along the lines of
the nerves distributed to the affected muscles.
After the third application the spasm was manifestly
relieved, the distortion being diminished,
and the paroxysms occurring less frequently. By
persisting with this treatment thrice weekly over
a period of two months, so great an amount of
relief was obtained that little distortion of the face
remained, and the patient was able to pursue her
business with comfort.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Emotional Aphonia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Electrization by sparks
over the larynx has been found so effective in the
relief of cases of hysterical or <em>emotional aphonia</em>,
even those of long standing, that it is well to use
it in the treatment of these cases before having
recourse to induced electricity. In six or seven
recent cases, this form of application repeated
twice or thrice effected a complete cure. One of
these cases was of nine, another of six months’
duration. The remainder had lasted from four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weeks to three months. The seventh case did not
receive any benefit from the use of static electricity,
and the other forms of the agent proved equally
ineffective. The case recovered slowly under
general treatment.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Localized Excessive Sensitiveness.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Electrization by sparks over
the affected spot has often proved of great benefit
in removing the <em>localized excessive sensitiveness</em> not
unfrequently found in hysterical cases, particularly
in the spinal region.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Tremor.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> <em>Tremor</em>, whether general or
local, is sometimes largely relieved by insulating
the patient, and charging him with positive electricity
for a period of twenty minutes to half an
hour. Other applications failing, I would advise
always, in cases similar to the above, a fair trial,
say half a dozen sittings, of Franklinization.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h4>ELECTRIZATION.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Electro-therapeutics.</div>

<p>We have seen that if we send a shock of electricity
through a motor nerve the nerve becomes
excited, and responds by contraction of its
muscles. One form of electricity, then, is a stimulant,
but, unlike other stimulants, it admits of its

If muscular
contraction results, it acts in addition as an artificial
gymnast, imitating natural muscular action
in a way quite impossible to any agency but electricity.
It is in cases where there is muscular
response to it, but not to the will, that it is often
of immense service, and it can then be replaced by
no other remedy known to medicine. Need I say
that in such cases its dosage is of importance;
that only a certain amount of stimulation being
needed, this may not be carried to the point of exhaustion,
and that the application should not be
continued for too long a time. From ten to twenty
minutes for an entire application is usually sufficient.
So much for the stimulant effects of electricity
when administered under either of its forms
in a series of intermittent “shocks.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Constant Current.</div>

<p>But we get a very different result when we
employ a constant current&mdash;that is, a continuous
stream of electricity without interruption or break
in it, and without appreciable variation in its
strength. One effect of the administration of such
a flow of electricity is that of a sedative, for it
possesses the most remarkable power in relieving
pain. We have all heard of the benefit of the
“constant current” in neuralgia, and it is worthy
of its reputation, and will not disappoint us if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
administer it with the precautions noted in my
last Lecture. (<a href="#Footnote_12_12">See foot-note, page 52</a>.)<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Electricity possesses an influence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>.</div>

<p>Electricity, then, according to its variety and
method of administration, is both a stimulant and
a sedative; but although these words may be used
as convenient distinctive terms, there is no doubt
that it is something more, and that it possesses an
influence quite <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, dependent, perhaps, upon
its modification of the natural state of the electricity
of the human body.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Restorative power of Voltaic Current.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Voltaic current
enjoys a remarkable restorative power, for it has
been found that its prolonged action upon a nerve
immediately after death will preserve its irritability
for a length of time, and that even in a dead
nerve the lost irritability may be again established.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electricity in Fatigue Diseases.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Dr. Poore has particularly studied this
restorative or refreshing effect of the Voltaic current,
especially in its application to a class of diseases
(termed by him “fatigue diseases”), and of
which writer’s cramp is a type, chiefly characterized
by an intense feeling of fatigue upon any attempt
being made to execute certain muscular movements.
This tired feeling is at once removed by
the application of the Voltaic current, either to
the muscles affected or to their nerves, and this
result Dr. Poore believes to be explained by an
increase in the susceptibility of the muscles to the
stimulus of the will. Be this as it may, such an
application is often most comforting, and it is not
unusual for the patient to experience immediate
and most grateful relief, and to beg for its repetition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Many electro-therapeutists will attribute
this relief to the production of, as it is termed, a
condition of electrotonus, about which, and its
importance in electro-therapeutics, a great deal
has been written and disputed.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electrotonus.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Electrotonus is
simply a name given to signify the state of a nerve
while it is being traversed by an artificial Voltaic
current. The effects of such an application, of
course, depend chiefly upon the power of the current.
If sufficiently powerful complete functional
destruction of the nerve would result, as by a
lightning flash; and as the tension of electricity is
greater at one pole than the other, we naturally,
with currents of a certain strength, discover modifications
of irritability in the nerve when specially
influenced by either pole. The irritability is
increased in the half nearest to the negative pole
(Katelectrotonus), decreased in the half nearest to
the negative pole (Anelectrotonus), and unchanged
at a point midway between the two poles (point
of indifference). The production of the general
electrotonic state is of importance. I believe
these lesser variations of anelectrotonus and katelectrotonus
to be practically of little moment,
and I advise you to disregard them in therapeutics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impotence.</div>

<p>The restorative effect of the Voltaic current
is frequently of benefit in sexual weakness. In
functional cases, the current may be applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
spine&mdash;positive pole to mid-dorsal region; negative
well painted over lumbar twice daily for ten
minutes upon getting up and going to bed. This
treatment was adopted in the case of a gentleman,
fifty years of age, who consulted me for gradual
decrease of sexual power, ending in complete impotence.
Six weeks’ treatment resulted, the patient
informed me, in the complete restoration of the
normal function.</p>

<p>Very marked absorbent or resolvent effects are
also exerted by the Voltaic current, and are probably
chiefly due to its powerful chemical action,
for a current of great strength will dissolve or
destroy any animal tissue whatever. One application
of this chemical action is found in the electrolysis
of tumours; another in the coagulation of
blood in aneurisms;<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and a third in the removal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
or absorption of gouty and rheumatic deposits.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rheumatic Gout.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> In
Rheumatic Gout, Dr. Poore has recorded a very
successful result from the use of localized galvanization.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The disease had existed for three months,
but the severity of the pain had much diminished,
excepting towards evening, when exacerbations
occurred. The wrist was considerably swollen,
and absolutely stiff, the hand pronated and could
not be supinated, and the hand and fingers were
immensely swollen, so as completely to obscure
their anatomy, while the fingers were extended,
stiff, pale, and cold, and the nutrition of the entire
limb impaired. The whole limb, and especially
the hand, was thoroughly sponged with the negative
pole, the positive being held in the patient’s
other hand. After the third application the swelling
rapidly subsided, and in about a fortnight the
hand, although still stiff, had resumed its natural
aspect. The muscles were then faradized and
shampooed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rheumatic Arthritis.</div>

<p>Rheumatic arthritis with nodosities is best
treated by passing as strong a Voltaic current as
the patient will submit to through each swollen
joint for a few minutes, the direction of the
current being frequently changed by the movement
of the commutator of the poles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Muscular Rheumatism.</div>

<p>The pains of muscular rheumatism are almost
invariably removed or mitigated by cutaneous
faradization, and so rapidly as in many cases to
appear marvellous. In cases that had resisted
all other treatment, an instantaneous cure has
resulted, and sufferers whose pain has for a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
time obliged them to keep the arm immovable
have been able directly after the faradization to
execute any movement with ease. With these
rheumatic patients it is especially of importance
that the current should be strictly limited to the
skin, carefully dried and powdered, and should
<em>produce no muscular contraction</em>, or the suffering
will be aggravated instead of relieved. Begin
with a current readily bearable on your own hand,
and increase afterwards. The above remarks are
applicable to all varieties of muscular rheumatism,
but not to arthritic disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General effects of Electrization.</div>

<p>So much for the general effects of electricity.
All the structures of the body respond to its
application; the muscles and motor nerves, as
we have seen, by contraction; the nerves of common
sensation by a burning or pricking; and of
the nerves of special sense; the retina by a flash
of light; the auditory nerve by a sound; the olfactory
nerve by a peculiar smell; and the gustatory
by a metallic taste, differing at the two poles.
The action of the Voltaic current upon the brain
is exceedingly powerful, and the greatest care
must be exercised when it is applied to any part
of the head or face. Not more than two or three
cells should be commenced with. Its effect should
be noted, and any increase should be made gradually.
With a very moderate current giddiness
is produced, and upon the sudden application of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sufficiently powerful one the patient falls down as
if struck by a blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Debility.</div>

<p>All, or some of the more or less generalized
applications, such as Beard and Rockwell’s generalized
electrization, the common Faradaic and
Voltaic Baths, or Radcliffe’s Charge, are of occasional
benefit in conditions of general debility,
and where general stimulation of the nervous
centres is indicated. The electric bath is an elegant
and pleasant mode of administering electricity,
but it is less generally beneficial (except in
certain gouty or rheumatic cases) than localized
applications of electricity. The statement that
metallic poisons can be eliminated from the body
by its agency has not yet been established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paralysis.</div>

<p>There are very few, I think I may almost say
not one, of the many disorders classed under the
heading of paralysis, in which at some time or
other of their progress some form of electrization
is not essential to their most successful treatment.
Where powerless to cure it will not unfrequently
relieve the most distressing symptoms. Cases of
functional paralysis from slight pressure are not
uncommon, when power may usually be restored
by a few Faradizations; but in paralysis from
severe central or peripheral lesion progress must of
necessity be slow. Such cases, regarded electrically,
may be most conveniently considered under
the two divisions of atrophic and non-atrophic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
paralysis.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Atrophic Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the great majority of atrophic cases
there will be found abolition or modification of the
normal electrical reaction of nerve and muscle,
but whether this is so or not, in all cases of loss of
power, in which any muscular wasting is visible,
the localization of electricity in the wasting
muscles is <em>imperative</em>, and in some varieties it is
the only treatment which will arrest the disease.
It is in these latter cases that its early administration
is called for, before the degeneration and
disappearance of the muscular tissue, and its early
and judicious use will not seldom save the sufferer
from being left for life with a powerless, or
withered and deformed, limb.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Infantile Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
As an illustration,
let us review the progress of a case of essential
infantile paralysis, the most common of the paralyses
of children; that form in which premonitory
symptoms are often absent, or but slight, and
where there is no rigidity. Very shortly after its
onset, usually within a few days, the limb is found
to be colder than its fellow, and its muscles to be
rapidly wasting; the final result, if untreated,
being the entire disappearance of some of them
and the production of deformity. In fact, the
larger number of cases of club-foot and analogous
distortions are brought about by neglected infantile
paralysis, and there is no doubt that by
judicious treatment, of which early electrization is
the foundation, the majority of them might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been prevented. The leading orthopædic surgeons
are fully alive to this fact, but they are powerless,
as they are rarely consulted until all the mischief
has resulted.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Importance of early Electrical Treatment.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The early recognition and appropriate
treatment of these cases must continue in
the hands of the family practitioner, and he must
decide whether or not they are to continue, as
at present is unfortunately too commonly the
case, without any serious attempts at restorative
treatment until commencing deformity compels
attention to them. As soon as the medical attendant
is summoned&mdash;and this is frequently only
because the parents have noticed that the child is
lame&mdash;he should carefully examine the muscles
electrically, and unless there are head symptoms
present, and this is very seldom, he should electrize
each muscle daily with that current to which
it responds, and of a strength just sufficient to
produce muscular contraction. If the powerless
muscles have preserved their Farado-contractility
it may be confidently predicted that they will
rapidly recover; but it will almost invariably be
found that while Farado-contractility is diminished
or abolished, there is increased response to the
interrupted Voltaic current. They should be
treated then with this current alone. Hot spongings
and shampooings should also be employed,
and it is of great importance that in the intervals
of treatment the temperature of the affected
muscles should be maintained at as high a degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
as possible. If the leg is affected, a stocking of
pure spun silk should be constantly worn, day and
night, in addition to the ordinary clothing; if the
arm, a silken sleeve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of active and passive movements in Paralysis.</div>

<p>When in any form of paralysis <span class="smcap">ANY</span> amount of
voluntary power has been restored by electricity,
it is most important that the patient should be
encouraged to use the limb and practise various
movements. Passive movements are of equal importance,
and the paralyzed muscles should be
frequently exercised by this mode to the fullest
extent of their normal movements. For example,
if the extensors of the hand and fingers are paralyzed,
the hand and fingers should be passively
flexed and extended completely, at intervals of a
few seconds, for some minutes, and so on with all
the paralyzed muscles in succession.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rule for Muscular Electrization.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> As soon as
there is return of reaction to Faradization, Faradization
should be alone used, and the rule in all
cases of localized muscular electrization, muscular
contraction being sought, is to use that current to
which the muscles respond, and <em>I do not know of
any exception to this rule</em>; but a successful result in
severe cases of atrophic&mdash;not alone infantile paralysis,
but all varieties of atrophic paralysis&mdash;is
brought about by painstaking, daily, tedious, uninteresting
treatment, with no chance of brilliant or
rapid results, but which if thoroughly, faithfully,
and patiently carried out, will reward us by progressive
improvement, and sometimes&mdash;even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
cases regarded not long ago as quite hopeless&mdash;complete
recovery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rigid form of Infantile Paralysis.</div>

<p>There are certain forms of paralysis affecting
children where the muscles are rigid. Localization
of any form of electricity in these rigid muscles is
quite useless; but if these cases depend upon
adhesions or exudations into the medulla their
absorption may possibly be promoted by localizing
a Voltaic current in the superior cervical ganglia
of the sympathetic; two small conductors, leather,
tipped and well-moistened in connection with the
poles of a Voltaic battery being applied for four
or five minutes to the bottom of the auriculo-maxillary
fossæ on both sides. There seems no
doubt that such an application causes a dilatation
of the blood-vessels of the base of the brain,
and is likely therefore to promote absorption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Traumatic Paralysis.</div>

<p>In all cases of traumatic lesion&mdash;as by section of
a nerve&mdash;the paralysis is atrophic, and the treatment
I have recommended in infantile paralysis
should be assiduously employed. Mitchell, of
Philadelphia, whose experience of military surgery
is unrivalled, commences electrical treatment and
shampooing within a fortnight of the wound,
unless there are special circumstances to contra-indicate
it. Lead palsy requires similar treatment;
so does, perhaps, the commonest form of
peripheral palsy&mdash;facial palsy from neuritis of
the facial nerve.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Caution necessary in Electrizing Facial Muscles.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In electrizing the facial muscles
there is one caution necessary&mdash;especially to observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the rule of electrizing the muscles equally&mdash;for
I have several times met with a contraction
resulting from a too energetic Faradization of
some individual facial muscle, to the neglect of
the group with which it is in correlative action.
Such a contraction may sometimes be removed
by localizing in it for about five minutes a constant
Voltaic current from eight or ten cells; but
in the most favourable cases an unnatural expression
of countenance will generally persist for a
long time, from the non-recovery by the muscles
of their perfect “tone,” that quality which imprints
upon each face its characteristic features, and which
has been called the “Gymnast of the Soul.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wasting Palsy.</div>

<p>In that most distressing disease, Cruveilhier’s
atrophy or wasting palsy, medication is altogether
useless, and our one hope&mdash;not invariably a forlorn
one&mdash;is in electricity. Localized Faradization to
the muscles, alternately with Radcliffe’s Positive
Charge, together with galvanization of the sympathetic
or of the spinal cord, admit of trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hemiplegia.</div>

<p>In non-atrophic paralysis&mdash;of which hemiplegia
may be taken as a type&mdash;the propriety of electrization,
and especially the proper moment for
its application, requires careful consideration. In
both brain and spinal cord disease muscular
electrization is not advisable until some time
after the attack, or until the muscles exhibit
signs of impairment of nutrition from disuse. As
long as there is rigidity&mdash;especially with increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
reflex action&mdash;any stimulant application of electricity
is not likely to do good, and may do harm;
but in older cases&mdash;both hemiplegic and paraplegic&mdash;cases
of from six to eighteen months’
duration&mdash;the immediate benefit to be derived
from localized electrization is often remarkable,
especially in those cases where, after a partial
return of voluntary movement, the patient suddenly
stops short, and for weeks or months
makes no progress. As the sequel of electrization,
the hemiplegic patient able to use the arm
slightly, but not to feed himself, may regain
this power, to his infinite comfort, and the paraplegic
patient, able with difficulty to drag himself
along by crutches, is enabled to walk by the
aid of a stick. Some improvement is usually soon
obtained, and it is progressive for, perhaps, two or
three months, after which continued electrization
fails to increase it; but at a subsequent period&mdash;six
months afterwards&mdash;a renewed electrization
may give rise to a new improvement; but be
this as it may, whenever in these old-standing
cases we see signs of impaired nutrition, it is wise
to occasionally stimulate the muscles by Faradism.
We should endeavour&mdash;in the words of the late
Nestor of modern medicine, Sir Thomas Watson&mdash;“to
preserve the muscular part of the locomotive
apparatus in a state of health and readiness, until
peradventure that part of the brain from which
volition proceeds having recovered its functions, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the road by which its messages travel having been
repaired, the influence of the will shall again reach
and reanimate the palsied limbs.”<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Direct application of Voltaic Current to Brain.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In hemiplegia
the propriety of a direct application of the constant
Voltaic current to the brain must be thoughtfully
considered. In selected cases, where the clot or
softening is of limited extent, its removal may be
accelerated by a carefully localized current&mdash;two
or three cells&mdash;for two or three minutes to the
injured hemisphere, followed by Voltaization of
the cervical sympathetic (so-called) for four or five
minutes. After such an application there follows&mdash;according
to Althaus&mdash;“greater ease in the
head, as well as in the limbs, and if there has
been pain this is relieved.”
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electricity in Spinal Paraplegia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Similarly the
absorption of the inflammatory products may be
promoted in the earlier stages of spinal disease,
by localizing the Voltaic current in the parts
affected, especially where pain is present, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
we have reason to suppose that the myelitis is
circumscribed. The daily application of the
positive pole for about five minutes, and with
from ten to fifteen cells, to the painful spot&mdash;the
negative pole being held to an indifferent part of
the body&mdash;is likely to promote absorption. At
any rate it will sometimes relieve the pain. In
the later stages of paraplegia, as soon as there
is diminution of electro-irritability in the paralyzed
muscles they should be sponged with the
Voltaic current, or Faradized; and where anæsthesia
is present, a good painting with the wire
brush will often be of service.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Paraplegic Constipation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Paraplegic constipation
may frequently be relieved by Faradization
of the abdominal muscles, and the troublesome
dribbling of urine, so often present, by external
Faradization of the bladder&mdash;one pole to the
pubes, and two sponges from the second pole&mdash;one
to the sacrum and the other to the perineum.
Incontinence of urine in children may be similarly
treated.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Emotional Paralysis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Cases of hysterical or emotional paralysis
may frequently be benefited by the application
of the wire brush, which also sometimes acts
like a charm in removing anæsthesia, which,
although originally of central origin, continues
after the removal of its cause. Anæsthesia from
section of a nerve is sometimes persistent in this
way after repair of the nerve lesion.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Locomotor Ataxy.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The wire
brush is also useful in sometimes removing the
anæsthesia present in locomotor ataxy, some cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of which may be largely benefited also by the
constant current to the spine&mdash;one pole to nape of
neck, and the other to the lower lumbar vertebræ.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Electricity in Mental Diseases.</div>

<p>Electricity is coming into use in mental
diseases. Faradism, and especially cutaneous
irritation with the wire brush, would seem to be
most suitable for cases accompanied by depression
or torpor, the stimulating effects being of service
in inspiriting the patient, while the soothing influence
of a direct application of the <em>constant</em> Voltaic
current to the brain may be employed in cases of
over-excitement requiring a sedative.</p>

According to Golding Bird, it is the only
true emmenagogue that we possess. Be this as it
may, all of its forms are serviceable in stimulating
the secretions, and may be employed with success in
cases of suppression of the catamenia from a torpid
condition of the uterine organs. A generalized
application will often suffice. Let the patient sit
with her feet in tepid salt and water, in which is
immersed a wire from one of the poles of an induction
instrument in action, while a large sponge
from the other pole is held applied to the lumbar
region. Strength of current as much as she will
bear. Time, ten to fifteen minutes. The application
should be made twice daily for the three or
four days preceding the usual catamenial period.
If this method fails in its object, direct electrization
must be resorted to; but Franklinization
most often succeeds.</p>

<p>On the Continent electricity has been largely

<div class="sidenote">Faradization in Post-partum Hæmorrhage.</div>

<p>Gentlemen, it is my firm belief that if a Faradaic
instrument were at hand, and properly used, there
would never be another death from <em>post-partum</em>
hæmorrhage. The Faradaic current, thoroughly
localized in the uterus, will always produce its
contraction, not only while life persists, but even
for a limited time after death, but failure in localizing
electricity in an organ, withdrawn from
sight and covered with thick muscular tissue, is
especially liable to occur, unless the details of
application are conducted with extreme care.
Assume the case to be an example of severe <em>post-partum</em>
hæmorrhage, that the ordinary resources
of medicine have failed the obstetrician, and that
he fears every moment may be his patient’s last,
but he has an induction instrument at hand. Let
him waste no time, but at once introduce his right
hand into the cavity of the uterus and grasp in
his left the moistened sponge attached to one of
the conductors of the instrument in action. Let
an attendant, holding by its insulating handle the
conductor from the other pole (which should be a
well-moistened sponge) thoroughly paint with it,
as it were, the abdominal parietes, pressing it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
considerable force against the practitioner’s hand,

One conductor was applied to the os,

<div class="sidenote">Paralysis of Nerves of Special Sense.</div>

<p>The stimulant effects of electricity are occasionally
beneficial in the treatment of paralysis of the
nerves of special sense, especially of the optic and
auditory nerves, while its use has been advocated
in a multitude of diseases to which I shall not
further refer, than by saying that a clear comprehension
of the principles of electro-therapeutics
will prevent the occurrence of difficulty in any
special application of them; and let us shortly
recapitulate the most important of these principles.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Résumé of general principles of Electro-therapeutics.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
We have seen that electricity is a stimulant, a
sedative, a restorative, and an absorbent. Its
stimulant properties are chiefly of use in diseases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of debility, and notably in paralysis&mdash;its sedative
properties in the alleviation and removal of pain
and spasm, and notably in neuralgia&mdash;its restorative
properties in fatigue diseases, notably writer’s
cramp&mdash;and its absorbent properties in exudation
diseases, and notably in gout and rheumatism.
The dose of electricity consists of the addition of
two factors&mdash;firstly, the strength of the current,
whether Voltaic or Faradaic; secondly, its duration.
It is of essential importance that we do not
overdose our patient, but we are little likely to do
this if we adhere to the two cardinal rules&mdash;to use
the <em>minimum</em> power which will produce the results
we desire, and not to unduly prolong our application:
and really this question of “dosage” forces
us to consider how far it is advisable for the
medical practitioner who prescribes electricity to
sanction its administration by the patients themselves.
While there is no doubt that the most
explicit directions will often be misunderstood, or
fail in being correctly carried out, yet it would be
practically impossible (to say nothing of the
expense to the patient) for any medical man to
himself apply electricity daily for a lengthened
period; and we are compelled, in certain cases, to
do our best in instructing <em>some one attendant of the
patient</em> how to carry out the treatment, making
her do this a few times in our presence, <em>and looking
sharply after her afterwards</em>, and in addition explaining
everything as fully as possible to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
patient, or the patient’s friends. Moreover, we
must not lose sight of the fact that, with electricity
as with other remedies, the skill of the
physician is shown in determining how, when,
and in what dose to administer it, and his judgment
in selecting those cases in which its administration
may be wisely committed to others.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Gentlemen, allow me to thank
you for the attention with which you have listened
to these imperfect Lectures. I fear that I have
failed in doing full justice to their subject; but I
trust that I have succeeded in indicating the importance
of electricity, as a supplement to, not as
a substitute for, the more ordinary resources of
therapeutics: in removing any doubt as to the
class of cases calling for its employment; in supplying
any want of information regarding details
of its application; and especially in proving its
claim to be more fully employed in your daily
practice. A theoretical belief in its efficacy is
widespread in our profession, its <em>frequent use</em> is
yet in the future, but I hope a not distant future.
Gentlemen, with you rests the decision whether
this shall or shall not be. You will decide it
not by the dictum of any specialist, but by the
general voice of the profession, declaring your
verdict as founded alone on your own personal
experience.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3_3" href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This observation, made in 1873, requires some qualification
now (1886). At several of the great medical schools, though not at
all, electrical treatment has been transferred from the hospital
porter to some member of the hospital staff; and at more than one
a systematic course of lectures upon electro-therapeutics has been
delivered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4_4" href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> I speak feelingly upon this matter, for from an early period
of my electrical experience I have suffered much from batteries&mdash;from
instruments “striking work” at the most inconvenient
moment&mdash;from spilling of corrosive acid upon fingers and clothing,
to the detriment of both, and of temper too, I fear.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5_5" href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> So long ago as 1870, I was in the habit (at the suggestion of
Dr. Radcliffe) of employing at an Institution for Resident Patients,
a method of “charging” a patient which I believe to be unique.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><em>Unique method of charging a patient.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
</p>
<p>
During dry summer weather the patient reclined upon a couch in
the gardens insulated by glass supports, and a sort of lightning
conductor was improvised by attaching a 30-feet salmon-rod to
the foot of the couch, a piece of ordinary “telegraph wire” being
carried up the rod, its insulation being removed from about a foot
which projected above the top of the rod.
</p>
<p>
Upon a fairly warm and dry day the patient became “charged”
and sparks could be drawn from him as from a patient in ordinary
connection with a Franklinic machine in rotation.
</p>
<p>
Upon more than one occasion in those ancient Static days, an
attempt was made to insulate a patient for a whole night, and to
maintain the charge by a relay of “rotating nurses;” but the <em>human
machines failed</em>, and suitable gas engines were not then available;
hence the procedure related above was, if conducted for three or
four hours on a dry summer afternoon, a by no means bad substitute
for a close room and a rotating Static machine. In New York, in
winter, when the rooms are covered with thick carpets, and when
the atmosphere is dry, it has been known that on shaking hands
with a visitor, not only has the “shock,” which under similar
circumstances occasionally occurs in England, been felt, but that a
spark has passed; and children have been known to slide over the
carpet towards each other and exchange sparks by way of sport.
<em>The influence of atmospheric and other ordinary electrical conditions
has been far too little studied by electro-therapeutists.</em></p></div>

dose of voltaic electricity is made up of two factors, (<em>a</em>) the strength
of the current and (<em>b</em>), the time during which it is applied to the
patient.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Galvanometer as an aid to the Dosage of Electricity.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The strength of the current is directly dependent upon
the number of cells employed, but, unfortunately, cells of dissimilar
construction evolve currents of very unequal strength; while cells
that have been freshly charged are more powerful than similar
ones that have been partly exhausted by use; and, therefore, to
speak of a current from “so many cells,” though, practically, a
convenient method of dosage, fails to convey any <em>exact</em> idea of a
measured and unvarying quantity. It is a comforting theory to
electro-therapeutists that a galvanometer will enable them to
administer their doses of electricity with as much exactitude as
we daily prescribe so many grains, or so many minims of ordinary
medicines; but, like some other theories which save us much
trouble, when adopted as theories <em>only</em>, it fails us in practice (at
least according to my experience), and chiefly so, because a galvanometer
can be usefully employed only when it is included in the
circuit of a continuous current, as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i>, in aneurismal electro-puncture;
and, I believe, I am within the mark in saying that
electrizations, which even admit of its useful employment, are
indicated in barely 5 per cent. of ordinary cases in electro-therapeutics;
and that it is of no practical utility, where we most want
aid, in measuring, not the current which leaves the battery
terminals, but that which, after overcoming the very variable
resistance of the human skin, really reaches the underlying
muscular and nervous tissues, which, in 95 per cent. of our cases,
we desire to influence, not by a constant, but by an interrupted
Voltaic current; and the amount which really reaches these tissues
depends largely upon the condition of the patient’s skin, and, I
may also add, upon the kind and shape of the conductor, and its
degree of moisture, &amp;c.; and the operator will do well to graduate
his dose of electricity by a consideration only of the three factors,
number of cells, effect upon himself, and effect upon his patient,
discarding entirely the use of any merely mechanical aids to
graduation.
</p>
<p>
I am induced to speak thus strongly because men of scientific
reputation have advocated the habitual use of the galvanometer,
not alone by medical men trained to precision of observation, but
by private patients as “<em>enabling them to carry on the treatment at
home with all the accuracy desirable!</em>” The prospect of the
ordinary patient provided with a battery, the use of which he is
complicating by a galvanometer, is anything but reassuring to
those physicians who not only prescribe electricity, but are themselves
habituated in applying it&mdash;which, by the way, is a very
different thing&mdash;and who have had frequent experience of the
manner in which patients misunderstand, or fail in correctly
carrying out, the most explicit directions. Electricity will be left
in the hands of specialists, and necessarily do but a tithe of the
good it is capable of affecting, until the mass of the profession can
be induced to master the few preliminary details essential to its
successful application, and I fear that the suggestions that have
been made&mdash;suggestions which I believe to be entirely without
foundation&mdash;that there exist practical difficulties to its dosage,
will tend to postpone rather than to accelerate its more extended
use.
</p>
<p>
Should any of you desire to use a galvanometer, that patented
by Sprague, of Birmingham, is the one most adapted for use in
medicine. Electricity is a force, and as with other forces it has
its standard of measurement. In mechanics we know that the
power sufficient to raise one pound to the height of one foot is the
basis of measurement. Similarly in electricity the unit of measurement
is the force which will raise one gramme to the height of one
metre, and the standard multiple of this was called a “British
Association Unit,” or shortly, a “B.A.” unit, and it is now called
an “<em>Ohm</em>” when used to measure the resistance offered to the
current, and a “<em>Veber</em>” when used to measure the strength of the
current itself. The ordinary galvanometer is founded on the
principle that a magnetic compass needle has a tendency to place
itself at right angles to a current of electricity, and the degree to
which the needle is deflected is a measure of the quantity of
electricity, but the angle of deflection is not proportionate to the
current strength, and it differs in different galvanometers; but in
“Sprague’s Galvanometer” the dial is divided, not into degrees,
but into divisions of thousandths of <em>Vebers</em>&mdash;divisions which were
obtained by noting the deflections given by the needle with currents
of known strength. I am indebted to Mr. Sprague for his courtesy
in endeavouring to so modify his galvanometer as to render it
available as a graduator of doses of interrupted Voltaic electricity,
but although he has not succeeded in doing this, he has constructed
for me an instrument which, supposing that a battery be partially
exhausted, will indicate with precision the absolute strength of, say,
twelve of its cells as compared with twelve newly-charged cells, and
also the condition of each individual cell, points often of much
practical convenience in an Hospital Electrical Room.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9_9" href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> A little care is needed to regulate the vibrating needle. The
spring should but <em>barely touch</em> the hammer, the adjustment being
almost entirely regulated by the protrusion or retraction of the
needle by the action of its screw; and the <em>slightest twist</em> of this
screw will be sufficient. When the vibration is uneven or stops,
and careful manipulation of the needle fails to re-establish it,
remove the needle and clean its point as directed in the text.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_12_12" href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> It is often of imperative importance in the administration of
the “constant” current that we should really localize it&mdash;not in

always quite so easy in practice as in theory.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Importance of exactitude in administering a constant current.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
To secure the result
we desire, we must see that the cord or wire from the terminals
of the battery to the electrodes is without flaw; that the electrodes
are well moistened and placed firmly in the position determined
upon; and especially that they are held quite immovable during
the entire application, for if not maintained immovable, we shall
be using not a “constant” but an “interrupted” current with
totally dissimiliar physiological and therapeutical effects! We
must satisfy ourselves that the current from our battery is also
constant, and that we so apply it to our patients that the affected
nerve shall be&mdash;as it is called&mdash;included in the circuit&mdash;that is,
between the poles, and that the current circulates through this
nerve as perfectly and continuously as it would through a piece of
wire connecting the terminals of the battery.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_14_14" href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Since writing as above, in 1873, our knowledge of the beneficial
effects of Franklinism has been very largely added to and the
improved apparatus, described at <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>, has enabled the treatment
to be conducted with a degree of precision and success
impossible with the comparatively imperfect instruments in use
at that date.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><em>Importance of distinguishing between the Positive and Negative Charge of Franklinism.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Dr. Radcliffe has contended for many years that
the effect of a charge of <em>positive</em> electricity differs altogether
therapeutically from that of a negative charge; and Giacomini
(quoted by Duchenne<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>) attributes a hyposthenic influence to
the <em>negative</em> charge. He contends that this charge is derived
from the nerves of the patient instead of from the ground as
is the positive charge, and it is ranked by the Italian School
among their most valuable hyposthenisants. According to
Giacomini the “patient is <em>de-electrized, is consequently deprived
of a greater or less quantity of a stimulant analogous to heat and
undergoes a real hyposthenisant effect</em>. Erysipelatous tissues may
be seen to become blanched under its influence, and chronic
inflammations undergo an unquestionable improvement. Headaches
and neuralgic pains have been instantly relieved by this kind
of electric flux as by the application of ice, which abstracts heat,
and perhaps at the same time electricity also.”
</p>
<p>
In reference to the above it has been proved by various physicists
that the natural electrical nerve current is strengthened by the
positive charge, and weakened by the negative&mdash;and hence it
would seem to be established that Dr. Radcliffe’s contention is the
right one; and that these two charges are literally “wide as their
poles asunder” not only physically, but <em>therapeutically</em>, and this
divergence is more important when we recall to mind that when a
patient is insulated, not only does the electricity accumulate upon
the surface of the skin but that the whole body is saturated with
it as a sponge may be with water.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><em>Franklinization in Conditions of Debility.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
</p>
<p>
In my own experience the positive charge has been of great good
as a most potent restorer when the organism from any cause has
become enfeebled. In the general weakness of old age it would
seem to have been beneficial upon several occasions in resuscitating
vital action and in imparting new force and energy. I have also
used it with the best results in conditions of debility following
acute diseases, as for example in convalescence from fevers; in
cases of general prostration from overwork or anxiety&mdash;and in
some cases of phthisis and other wasting diseases. In certain
varieties of mental disease&mdash;notably melancholia&mdash;it is often of
service, and in cerebral anæmia, in asthma, in inveterate
insomnia, and in all functional uterine irregularities it should be
employed <em>before, not after</em>, all other therapeutic agencies have been
exhausted.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_16_16" href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> In the treatment of <em>Neuralgia</em> by the constant current the
electrodes should be so applied as to include between them the
part or nerve affected&mdash;the number of cells the highest number
that can be borne without pain, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, the current to be distinctly
but not painfully felt, both electrodes being immovable.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electricity in Neuralgia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Time,
five to ten minutes. Frequency, as often as the attacks of pain
recur. I am satisfied that in severe cases this rule of application
is essential&mdash;that the influence of the current shall be maintained
as much as may be in the irritable nerve during the intervals of
pain. In one case under my care the patient was galvanized with
benefit 27 times in the 24 hours; but in milder cases one or two
applications daily will generally suffice. A weak current from two
or three cells&mdash;the electrodes being applied to each temple for one
or two minutes&mdash;will sometimes dissipate a severe headache. This
soothing influence of the current is often useful in allaying <span class="smcap">Spasm</span>,
as, for example, in spasmodic torticollis. The current should be
localized in the irritable muscles: and it is generally advisable to
energetically Faradize their antagonists and to conjoin with the
electrical treatment appropriate gymnastic exercises, alternating
with periods of perfect rest. I may mention that the only
recorded case of improvement in that remarkable condition of
spasm first described by Hammond under the name of <em>Athetosis</em>
resulted from the Voltaic current. The case was brought before
the Medico-Chirurgical Society by Dr. Gowers, and is published
in the 49th volume of their Transactions. The reader will find the
subject of neuralgia very exhaustively considered in Dr. Anstie’s
work.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He quotes some extremely severe cases in which the effect
of Electrization was to arrest the pain in a few sittings, and to
procure a remission for several days or even weeks; and I have had
several cases which I believe to have been as fairly cured as an ague
fit may be said to be cured by quinine. Dr. Russell Reynolds also
quotes the case of a patient, a lady, who for twenty years had
suffered from an extremely severe neuralgia of the ophthalmic
branch of the fifth nerve, which recurred daily and from which her
health had greatly suffered. It was not only relieved but removed
by a single application.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_18_18" href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Electrolysis is, of course, chiefly applicable to tumours which,
from their nature or situation, are difficult or impossible to be
removed by the knife; and, perhaps, also to malignant tumours;
for whether or not the Voltaic current exerts a special destructive
influence upon diseased germs, it seems certainly proved that
there is a less frequent return of cancerous growths removed by
its agency than by ordinary operative procedures or by caustics.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electrolysis of Tumours.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
</p>
<p>
This treatment of malignant tumours by electrolysis is yet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub
judice</i>, but the evidence in its favour has recently much accumulated,
and its full and exhaustive trial by competent observers
possessing the opportunities of large hospital practice ought not
to be much longer delayed.<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electrolysis of Malignant Tumours.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Neftel, of New York, who is its
chief advocate, contends that malignant tumours are at first
entirely local, and he explains their recurrence, after removal by
the knife, from the fact of the impossibility of the whole of the
diseased mass being excised, as apparently healthy parts when
microscopically examined show that they have already become
infected. Electrolysis he considers acts not only on the tumour
but also on the surrounding tissues, the current being diffused to
some distance in all directions. After electrolysis he applies a
mild and not painful current for from a quarter to half an hour
daily to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus morbi</i>, and continues this for some months. In
one of his cases a mammary tumour existed of the size of a small
orange. Three needles, from the negative pole of thirty-five cells,
were inserted for half an hour under chloroform, and the operation
was repeated thrice at intervals of a week, daily external galvanization
being also used. The tumour gradually became smaller, and
at last disappeared, but external treatment was continued for
several months. At the end of a year there had been no relapse.
In another case, in which the tumour had been excised by Marion
Sims, it reappeared, and was again removed by the same surgeon,
and pronounced cancerous. It again reappeared and was then
electrolyzed, upon three occasions, by two, three, and four needles
respectively, and with a current gradually increased from ten to
thirty cells. The tumour by degrees grew less, and in three months
was entirely dispersed; while, when the patient died from another
disease three years afterwards, there had been no recurrence.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Aneurismal Electro-puncture.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis has been successfully employed in several cases of
aneurism. Where pressure and ligature admit of application, it
is hardly necessary to say that the preference should be given to
them; but many internal aneurisms, and especially aortic aneurisms,
cannot be thus treated, and in such cases the question of
electro-puncture should be carefully considered, and, when called
for, it should not be too long delayed. Two fine, sharp, and
carefully insulated needles, one connected with each pole, should
be introduced into the aneurismal sac, and the current allowed to
pass for from half an hour to an hour, the needles carefully
withdrawn, and their punctures covered with a bit of lint soaked
in collodion or styptic colloid. Authorities are divided as to the
kinds of aneurism calculated for electro-puncture, but there is no
doubt than an aneurism pressing on the parietes, but not having
actually perforated them, is the best adapted for this treatment,
and that it is contra-indicated where the sac is of large size, or
where large trunks issue from it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19_19" href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The following is an illustrative case:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
A lady, forty-one years of age, had suffered from right hemiplegia
for eighteen months, and described her condition as having
remained without improvement for the past six months. She had
recovered sufficiently to walk with the aid of a stick, but the movements
of the arm were very weak, especially those of the deltoid,
extensors of the fingers, and individual muscles of the hand.
Faradic contractility was somewhat lowered, but there was no
rigidity. The muscles were carefully Faradized with a current just
sufficiently strong to produce their contraction. The entire application
occupied about fifteen minutes, and was made once daily.
After a fortnight’s electrization she was able to raise the arm to a
right angle with the body, and <em>to use the hand to feed herself</em>,
neither of which had she been able to do before treatment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20_20" href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The following is an extract from Dr. Sturge’s Report of the
results of treatment at the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and
Epileptic:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“In the division of Muscular Atrophies some striking cases have
occurred, and in all of these the improvement is mainly due to the
electrical treatment prescribed.
</p>
<p>
“A patient, with atrophy of some of the muscles of both arms
of six months’ standing, which incapacitated her from dressing
herself or cutting her food, or doing much household work, was
discharged at the end of three and a half months, able to feed and
dress herself, sew, and perform almost any domestic duty.
</p>
<p>
“Another woman, with atrophy of the muscles of the forearm of
several years’ standing, and who was similarly incapacitated from
almost all use of the hands, went out, after a month’s treatment,
able to dress and feed herself, and to perform many actions that
were before impossible for her.
</p>
<p>
“A man came to the hospital with atrophy of many muscles in
various parts of the body, more especially in the left arm, which
he was unable to move from the side. He went out able to lift his
arm well over his head, and with much increased strength in the
limb.
</p>
<p>
“Another man, in a very similar condition, was also greatly
benefited; and whereas on admission he could barely bend the right
arm at the elbow, after three months’ treatment he was able to use
a hammer with the arm.”</p></div></div>

DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS<br />
SYSTEM.</p>

<p>Within the past few years the treatment of Diseases of the
Nervous System has grown up into a recognised speciality in
the Medical Profession. Recent investigations, physiological,
clinical, and pathological, have cast a flood of light upon its
study, and it possesses&mdash;as a separate field of practice&mdash;Special
Hospitals, and a voluminous and rapidly extending literature.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the Author, although fully conscious
of the extreme difficulty of presenting, within a small
compass, an adequate view of our present knowledge, feels
that a concise introduction to neuro-pathology may not be unacceptable
to students and junior practitioners. It will be his
endeavour to give the results of the best work by the many
distinguished physicians, both English and Foreign, who have
so completely made this department of medicine their own;
to impart as much practical information as possible; to give an
analysis of the principles which ought to govern our treatment
of diseases of the Nervous System; and to direct especial
attention to the importance of early diagnosis. He hopes to
omit nothing really essential, and to make the work a safe
and trustworthy guide to the practice of the speciality upon
which it will treat.</p>

to congratulate him upon having so far accomplished an undertaking of much
utility.”&mdash;<cite>The Lancet.</cite></p>

<p>“We have to congratulate Dr. Tibbits upon his successful labours thus far.
This instalment promises that the results of the best subsequent work will be

<p class="center"><em>Opinions of the Medical Press.</em></p>

<p>“This work fills up a hiatus in the
literature of medical electricity. It
purposes to teach (to use the words
of the preface) ‘the busy practitioner
not only when to use electricity, but
in explicit and full detail how;’ and
in ‘moderate bulk to contain only
what it is essential to master.’ Dr.
Tibbits’ object has been to give the
results of the best work, and to this
end he has availed himself freely of
the large experience of the Electrical
Room of the National Hospital for
the Paralysed and Epileptic.</p>

<p>“The work is what it professes to
be, and is a handbook in the best
sense of the work. The book, indeed,
answers thoroughly to the author’s
description: that he has ‘throughout
endeavoured to keep constantly in
view the practitioner rather than the
theorist,’ especially in points of detail
which are of importance in order to
secure the successful application of
electricity, and to insure (a not insignificant
matter in this respect) the
comfort of the patient.”&mdash;<cite>The Lancet.</cite></p>

<p>“There is not a word of exaggeration,
or of fanciful hypothesis in the
book, and, above all, there is not the
least suggestion that there is after all
a mystery behind, and that the reader
would do well to come to an expert
for advice. On the contrary, everything
is made so clear that any practitioner,
whether he previously knew
anything of electricity or not, may
from this book at once begin the
practical use of it, and if there are
any lingering doubts in the minds of
some ultra-conservative persons as
to the practical value of electrical
treatment, this book should dispel
them.... the busiest practitioner
can, without difficulty, learn how to
effect a large amount of good which
he was previously quite unable even
to attempt.”&mdash;<cite>The Practitioner.</cite></p>

<p>“As Medical Superintendent of
the National Hospital for the Paralysed
and Epileptic, as well as through
private practice. Dr. Tibbits has had
ample opportunities of studying the
application of electricity to medicine,
and in the volume under notice, which
aims principally at giving full and explicit
details within convenient limits,
<em>how to use electricity</em>, we are bound to
say this object is fairly carried out.”&mdash;<cite>The
Dublin Journal of Medical
Science.</cite></p>

<p>“The exact value of electricity as a
therapeutic agent is imperfectly understood.
That it is of great value in
some cases as a means of improving
nutrition, relieving pain, and exercising
disused muscles, is undoubted,
but still its exact value in all cases
remains to be settled, and in Dr.
Tibbits’ book we find a guide which
will, at all events, help us to a solution
of some of our difficulties.&mdash;<cite>The
Medical Times and Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>“Dr. Tibbits, who is known as an
authority upon electricity, has written
a concise book upon this subject for
the general practitioner, embracing
only the valuable part of the existing
knowledge. The work is written in a
condensed style, and is well adapted
for the practitioner who does not make
a specialty of electrical treatment.”&mdash;<cite>The
New York Medical Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">TO USE THE GALVANIC CURRENT.</p>

<p>To use the galvanic current place the ends of the conducting
cords in the two binding posts marked <b>13-13</b>. Place the
socket of current selector (<b>20</b>) on the pin marked O, and turn
the lever of selector on pin No. <b>1</b>, or on any number, according
to the number of cells desired; at the same time see that all
the switch levers are on their blank buttons, except the one
at left of current selector, which should be on its left-hand
button marked Constant.</p>

<p>If it is desired to use cells from any other part of the series,
place the socket on the pin from which it is desired to begin,
and having previously moved the lever ahead of this pin move
it along until the desired number of cells intervenes between
socket and lever. The number of cells in circuit when the
socket is not on O, but on a pin with a number, is the difference
between the number of the pin and number on which
the lever rests, for instance, if socket is on pin <b>12</b> and lever on
pin <b>22</b>, then <b>10</b> cells are being used, the starting point being <b>12</b>
cells from any part of the series may thus be brought into the
circuit. If socket be placed on pin <b>39</b> and lever on pin <b>40</b> then
the <b>40</b>th cell would be in use only.</p>

<p><em>Always keep the socket on the lowest number and the lever on the highest,
as putting socket ahead of lever would reverse the current.</em></p>

<p>Should, through any accident, a cell become disconnected
or run down, or should it get out of order from any cause, it is
only necessary to short-circuit the cells and throw the milli-ampere-meter
in circuit by adjusting the switch <b>10</b>. By placing
the socket on the pin marked O and selecting cell after cell with
the lever, the defective cell is easily found by the milli-ampere-meter
failing to deflect when the pin corresponding to
the defect is reached.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">TO OBTAIN THE INTERRUPTED GALVANIC CURRENT.</p>

<p>To obtain the interrupted galvanic current, move the
switch at left of selector on to button marked interrupted,
then turn the switch just above the vibrator on to its button
marked <b>11</b>, by adjusting the screws at <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> the proper
degree of vibration will be obtained. It is necessary that the
point of the screws at <b>15</b> should touch the plate with every
vibration as the current passes through at this point and unless
it touches, connections would not be made.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">TO MEASURE THE RESISTANCE OF THE PATIENT.</p>

<p>To measure the resistance of the patient turn the lever at
the left of selector on to the button <b>8</b> marked milli-ampere-meter
and wire rheostat. Supposing him to have the electrodes
in his hands and a current from <b>30</b> cells registers <b>8</b> milli-amperes;
without changing any other conditions, throw the upper
left-hand lever <b>10</b> on button marked rheostat and milli-ampere-meter
only. The patient will now be thrown out and the needle
will fly around as far as it can go.</p>

<p>Begin by throwing in resistance, which is done by manipulating
the top row of levers, until the needle which will have
retraced its course rests directly over the division marked <b>8</b>
milli-amperes or whatever may have been the previously recorded
amount. The numbers on uncovered buttons added
together will be the resistance of the patient. The known
resistance having taken the place of the patient.</p>

<p><em>The upper left-hand lever should at all times except for purposes of
measuring the resistance of a patient, be kept on its blank button, or the battery
will be short circuited and injured.</em></p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">THE POLE CHANGER.</p>

<p>The pole changing lever above the two posts marked <b>13-13</b>,
when pressed between the two right-hand springs makes the
right-hand binding post positive, and when pressed between
the two left-hand springs the left-hand post becomes positive
and the right negative.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">GRAPHITE RHEOSTAT.</p>

<p>When the left-hand lever is placed on button <b>9</b> it throws
the graphite rheostat (<b>16</b>) into circuit. To use the rheostat
first draw up the rod (<b>17</b>). By slowly pressing the rod down
through the graphite it gradually lessens the resistance thereby
increasing the current without shock to the patient. With this
rheostat you can place any number of cells in the circuit.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">THE DE WATTEVILLE SWITCH.</p>

<p>The de Watteville switch is placed directly above the
pole changer is used for obtaining either the galvanic or the
faradic current separately or the two combined. When the
double lever rests on figure <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> the galvanic alone can be
used; can when on <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> the faradic can be alone used and
when on <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> the two currents are combined and used
without changing the conducting cords.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">THE FARADIC APPARATUS.</p>

<p>The Faradic apparatus of this cabinet combines a fast
and slow interrupter also a single contact key. The style of
coil used is the Du Bois-Raymond. To use <b>Primary</b> coil,
place the two tips on ends of conducting cords into the two
binding posts in front of the coil, the others being connected
with any desired electrodes. The strength is increased by
drawing the coil to the <b>Right</b>, first placing switch at right end
of coil on button marked P.</p>

<p>To use the secondary coil remove the tips of cords from
primary posts; then place the ends of cords in the two binding
posts <b>13-13</b> and place switch on right end of coil on button
marked <b>S</b>. To increase the strength of secondary, push coil
to the <b>Left</b> gradually, which is just <b>Opposite</b> to what is done
in case of primary current.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">THE USE OF THE INTERRUPTER.</p>

<p>To use the rapid interrupter which works against the end
of core it is only necessary to adjust the screw F, and any degree
of vibration may be obtained. The same may be said of
the slow interrupter which is adjusted by the screw D, but it
is further controlled by the sliding weight at E. By sliding the
weight up and down the interruptions are varied from very
slow to rapid.</p>

<p>The higher the weight the slower the interruptions and
vice-versa. At button G, is the “single contact” used in obtaining
single impulse contractions.</p>

<p>The different interrupters may be placed in circuit by a
switch on the base of the Cabinet which works over a series
of buttons marked S, F and C which put in operation the
slow, fast or single contact interrupters, as desired.</p>

<p class="center boldfont p1">DIRECTIONS FOR CONNECTING CELLS.</p>

<p>Fill the cells according to the directions on the cell label,
and connect the wires of the cable to the cells, as shown in the
cut; No. O being attached to zinc of the first cell, No. <b>1</b> to the
carbon of the first cell, while at the same time the carbon of the
first cell connected to the zinc of the second cell by strip from
the carbon of cell, No. <b>2</b> wire of the cable to the carbon of the
second cell, and so on, the last wire being connected to the
carbon of the last cell, as shown by No. <b>40</b>. The two wires
marked faradic should be connected as shown, the four cells
being placed in two rows of two each, the zincs and carbons
being connected together as shown in diagram.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
